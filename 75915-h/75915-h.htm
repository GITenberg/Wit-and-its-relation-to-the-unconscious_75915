  <h2 class='c005'>TRANSLATOR’S PREFACE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>In 1908 when it was agreed between Professor
Freud and myself that I should be his translator,
it was decided to render into English first the
following five works: <cite>Selected Papers on Hysteria
and Psychoneuroses</cite>,<a id='r1'></a><a href='#f1' class='c007'><sup>[1]</sup></a> <cite>Three Contributions
to the Theory of Sex</cite>,<a id='r2'></a><a href='#f2' class='c007'><sup>[2]</sup></a> <cite>The Interpretation
of Dreams</cite>,<a id='r3'></a><a href='#f3' class='c007'><sup>[3]</sup></a> <cite>Psychopathology of Everyday
Life</cite>,<a id='r4'></a><a href='#f4' class='c007'><sup>[4]</sup></a> and the present volume. These works
were selected because they represent the various
stages of development of Professor Freud’s Psychoanalysis,<a id='r5'></a><a href='#f5' class='c007'><sup>[5]</sup></a>
and also because it was thought that
they contain the material which one must master
before one is able to judge correctly the author’s
theories or apply them in practice. This undertaking,
which was fraught with many linguistic
and other difficulties, has finally been accomplished
<span class='pageno' id='Page_vi'>vi</span>with the edition of the present volume,
and it is therefore with a sense of great satisfaction
that the translator’s preface to this work
is written. But although the original task is
finished the translator’s work is only beginning.
Psychoanalysis has made enormous strides. On
the foundation laid by Professor Freud there
developed a literature rich in ideas and content
which has revolutionized the science of nervous
and mental diseases, and has thrown much light
on the subject of dreams, sex, mythology,<a id='r6'></a><a href='#f6' class='c007'><sup>[6]</sup></a> the
history of civilization and racial psychology,<a id='r7'></a><a href='#f7' class='c007'><sup>[7]</sup></a>
philology,<a id='r8'></a><a href='#f8' class='c007'><sup>[8]</sup></a> æsthetics,<a id='r9'></a><a href='#f9' class='c007'><sup>[9]</sup></a> child psychology and
pedagogics,<a id='r10'></a><a href='#f10' class='c007'><sup>[10]</sup></a> philology,<a id='r11'></a><a href='#f11' class='c007'><sup>[11]</sup></a> and mysticism and occultism.
With the <cite>Interpretation of Dreams</cite> and
<cite>Psychopathology of Everyday Life</cite>, Professor
Freud has definitely bridged the gulf between
normal and abnormal mental states by demonstrating
that dreams and faulty acts like some
forms of forgetting, slips of the tongue, slips of
reading, writing, etc., are closely allied to psychopathological
<span class='pageno' id='Page_vii'>vii</span>states and represent the prototypes
of such abnormal mental conditions as neurotic
symptoms, hallucinations, and deliria. He also
shows that all these productions are senseful
and purposive, and that their strange and peculiar
appearance is due to distortions produced by
various psychic processes. These views are confirmed
in the present volume, where it is demonstrated
that wit, which belongs to æsthetics, is
subject to the same laws, shows the same mechanism,
and serves the same tendencies as the
other psychic productions. With his wonted
profundity and ingenuity the author adds the
solution of wit to those of the neuroses, dreams,
and psychopathological acts.</p>

<p class='c008'>I take great pleasure in tendering my thanks
to Mr. Horatio Winslow, who has read the manuscript
and has given me valuable suggestions in
the choice of expressions and in the selection of
substitutes for those witticisms that could not be
translated.</p>

<p class='c006'>Whoever has had occasion to examine that
part of the literature of æsthetics and psychology
dealing with the nature and affinities of
wit, will, no doubt, concede that our philosophical
inquiries have not awarded to wit the
important rôle that it plays in our mental life.
One can recount only a small number of thinkers
who have penetrated at all deeply into the
problems of wit. To be sure, among the authors
on wit one finds the illustrious names of
the poet Jean Paul (Fr. Richter), and of the
philosophers Th. Vischer, Kuno Fischer, and Th.
Lipps. But even these writers put the subject
of wit in the background while their chief
interest centers around the more comprehensive
and more alluring problems of the comic.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the main this literature gives the impression
that it is altogether impractical to study
wit except when treated as a part of the comic.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>
  <h4 class='c016'><em>Presentation of the Subject by Other Authors</em></h4>
</div>

<p class='c017'>According to Th. Lipps (<cite><span lang="de">Komik und Humor</span></cite>,
1898<a id='r12'></a><a href='#f12' class='c007'><sup>[12]</sup></a>) wit is “essentially the subjective side
of the comic; i.e., it is that part of the comic
which we ourselves create, which colors our conduct
as such, and to which our relation is that
of Superior Subject, never of Object, certainly
not Voluntary Object” (p. 80). The following
comment might also be added:—In general
we designate as wit “every conscious and clever
evocation of the comic, whether the comic element
lies in the viewpoint or in the situation
itself” (p. 78).</p>

<p class='c008'>K. Fischer explains the relation between wit
and the comic by the aid of caricature, which,
according to his exposition, comes midway between
the two (<cite><span lang="de">Über den Witz</span></cite>, 1889). The
subject of the comic is the hideous element in
any of its manifestations. “Where it is concealed
it must be disclosed in the light of the
comic view; where it is not at all or but slightly
noticeable it must be rendered conspicuous and
elucidated in such a manner that it becomes
clear and intelligible. Thus arises caricature”
(p. 45). “Our entire psychic world, the intellectual
realm of our thoughts and conceptions,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>does not reveal itself to us on superficial
consideration. It cannot be visualized directly
either figuratively or intuitively, moreover it
contains inhibitions, weak points, disfigurements,
and an abundance of ludicrous and comical contrasts.
In order to bring it out and to make
it accessible to æsthetic examination, a force is
necessary which is capable not only of depicting
objects directly, but also of reflecting upon
these conceptions and elucidating them—namely,
a force capable of clarifying thought.
This force is nothing but judgment. The judgment
which produces the comic contrast is
wit. In caricature wit has played its part unnoticed,
but only in judgment does it attain
its own individual form and the free domain of
its evolution.”</p>

<p class='c008'>As can be seen Lipps assigns the determining
factor which classifies wit as part of the
comic, to the activity or to the active behavior
of the subject, whereas K. Fischer characterizes
wit by its relation to its object, in which characterization
he accentuates the hidden hideous
element in the realm of thought. One cannot
put to test the cogency of these definitions of
wit; one can, in fact, hardly understand them
unless one studies the text from which they were
taken. One is thus forced to work his way
through the author’s descriptions of the comic
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>in order to learn anything about wit. From
other passages, however, one discovers that the
same authors attribute to wit essential characteristics
of general validity in which they disregard
its relation to the comic.</p>

<p class='c008'>K. Fischer’s characterization of wit which
seems to be most satisfactory to this author runs
as follows: “Wit is a <em>playful</em> judgment” (p.
51). For an elucidation of this expression we
are referred to the analogy: “How æsthetic
freedom consists in the playful contemplation
of objects” (p. 50). In another place (p. 20)
the æsthetic attitude towards an object is characterized
by the condition that we expect nothing
from this object—especially no gratification
of our serious needs—but that we content ourselves
with the pleasure of contemplating the
same. In contrast to labor the æsthetic attitude
is <em>playful</em>. “It may be that from æsthetic freedom
there also results a kind of judgment, freed
from the conventional restrictions and rule of
conduct, which, in view of its genesis, I will
call the <em>playful</em> judgment. This conception contains
the first condition and possibly the entire
formula for the solution of our problem. ‘Freedom
begets wit and wit begets freedom,’ says
Jean Paul. Wit is nothing but a free play of
ideas” (p. 24).</p>

<p class='c008'>Since time immemorial a favorite definition
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>of wit has been the ability to discover similarities
in dissimilarities, i.e., to find hidden similarities.
Jean Paul has jocosely expressed this idea by
saying that “wit is the disguised priest who
unites every couple.” Th. Vischer adds the
postscript: “He likes best to unite those couples
whose marriage the relatives refuse to
sanction.” Vischer refutes this, however, by
remarking that in some witticisms there is no
question of comparison or the discovery of
similarities. Hence with very little deviation
from Jean Paul’s definition he defines wit as
the skill to combine with surprising quickness
many ideas, which through inner content and
connections are foreign to one another. K.
Fischer then calls attention to the fact that
in a large number of these witty judgments one
does not find similarities, but contrasts; and
Lipps further remarks that these definitions
refer to the wit that the humorist possesses and
not to the wit that he produces.</p>

<p class='c008'>Other viewpoints, in some measure connected
with one another, which have been mentioned in
defining and describing wit are: “the <em>contrast
of ideas</em>,” “<em>sense in nonsense</em>,” and “<em>confusion
and clearness</em>.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Definitions like those of Kraepelin lay stress
upon the contrast of ideas. Wit is “the voluntary
combination or linking of two ideas which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>in some way are contrasted with each other,
usually through the medium of speech association.”
For a critic like Lipps it would not be
difficult to reveal the utter inadequacy of this
formula, but he himself does not exclude the
element of contrast—he merely assigns it elsewhere.
“The contrast remains, but is not
formed in a manner to show the ideas connected
with the words, rather it shows the contrast or
contradiction in the meaning and lack of meaning
of the words” (p. 87). Examples show the
better understanding of the latter. “A contrast
arises first through the fact that we adjudge a
meaning to its words which after all we cannot
ascribe to them.”</p>

<p class='c008'>In the further development of this last condition
the antithesis of “sense in nonsense” becomes
obvious. “What we accept one moment
as senseful we later perceive as perfect nonsense.
Thereby arises, in this case, the operation of the
comic element” (p. 85). “A saying appears
witty when we ascribe to it a meaning through
psychological necessity and, while so doing, retract
it. It may thus have many meanings. We
lend a meaning to an expression knowing that
logically it does not belong to it. We find in
it a truth, however, which later we fail to find
because it is foreign to our laws of experience or
usual modes of thinking. We endow it with a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>logical or practical inference which transcends
its true content, only to contradict this inference
as soon as we finally grasp the nature of the expression
itself. The psychological process
evoked in us by the witty expression which gives
rise to the sense of the comic depends in every
case on the immediate transition from the borrowed
feeling of truth and conviction to the impression
or consciousness of relative nullity.”</p>

<p class='c008'>As impressive as this exposition sounds one
cannot refrain from questioning whether the contrast
between the senseful and senseless upon
which the comic depends does not also contribute
to the definition of wit in so far as it is distinguished
from the comic. Also the factor of
“confusion and clearness” leads one deeply into
the problem of the relation of wit to the comic.
Kant, speaking of the comic element in general,
states that one of its remarkable attributes is
the fact that it can delude us for a moment only.
Heymans (<cite><span lang="de">Zeitschr. f. Psychologie</span></cite>, XI, 1896)
explains how the mechanism of wit is produced
through the succession of confusion and clearness.
He illustrates his meaning by an excellent
witticism from Heine, who causes one of his figures,
the poor lottery agent, Hirsch-Hyacinth,
to boast that the great Baron Rothschild treated
him as an equal or quite FAMILLIONAIRE.
Here the word which acts as the carrier of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>witticism appears in the first place simply as a
faulty word-formation, as something incomprehensible,
inconceivable, and enigmatic. It is for
these reasons that it is confusing. The comic
element results from the solution of the enigma
and from the understanding of the word. Lipps
adds that the first stage of enlightenment, showing
that the confusing word means this or that, is
followed by a second stage in which one perceives
that this nonsensical word has first deluded us
and then given us the true meaning. Only this
second enlightenment, the realization that it is
all due to a word that is meaningless in ordinary
usage—this reduction to nothingness produces
the comic effect (p. 95).</p>

<p class='c008'>Whether or not either the one or the other
of these two conceptions may seem more clear
we are brought nearer to a definite insight
through the discussion of the processes of confusion
and enlightenment. If the comic effect of
Heine’s <em>famillionaire</em> depends upon the solution
of the seemingly senseless word, then the wit
would have to be attributed to the formation of
this word and to the character of the word so
formed.</p>

<p class='c008'>In addition to the associations of the viewpoints
just discussed there is another characteristic
of wit which is recognized as peculiar to it
by all authors. “Brevity alone is the body and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>soul of wit,” declares Jean Paul (<cite><span lang="fr">Vorschule der
Aesthetik</span></cite>, I, 45), and modifies it with a speech of
the old tongue-wagger, Polonius, from Shakespeare’s
<cite>Hamlet</cite> (Act II, Scene 2):</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c018'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Therefore, since brevity is the soul of wit,</div>
      <div class='line'>And tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes,</div>
      <div class='line'>I will be brief.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Lipps’s description (p. 90) of the brevity of
wit is also significant. He states that wit says
what it does say, not always in few, but always
in too few words; that is: “It expresses itself in
words that will not stand the test of strict logic
or of the ordinary mode of thought and expression.
In fine it can express itself by leaving the
thing unsaid.”</p>

<p class='c008'>That “wit must unearth something hidden and
concealed”—to quote K. Fischer (p. 51)—we
have already been taught from the grouping of
wit with caricature. I re-emphasize this determinant
because it also has more to do with the
nature of wit than with its relation to the comic.</p>

<p class='c008'>I am well aware that the foregoing scanty
quotations from the works of the authors on wit
cannot do justice to the excellence of these works.
In view of the difficulties that confront one in
reproducing clearly such complicated and such
delicately shaded streams of thought I cannot
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>spare inquiring minds the trouble of searching
for the desired information in the original
sources. However, I do not know whether they
will return fully satisfied. For the criteria and
attributes of wit mentioned by these authors,
such as—activity, the relation of the content of
wit to our thoughts, the character of the playful
judgment, the union of dissimilarities, contrasting
ideas, “sense in nonsense,” the succession of
confusion and clearness, the sudden emergence
of the hidden, and the peculiar brevity of wit,
seem to us, at first glance, so very pertinent and
so easily demonstrable by examples that we cannot
succumb to the danger of underestimating
the value of such ideas. But they are only disjointed
fragments which we should like to see
welded into an organic whole. In the end they
contribute no more to the knowledge of wit than
a number of anecdotes teach us of the true characteristics
of a personality whose biography interests
us. We do not at all understand the connection
that is supposed to exist between the individual
conditions; for instance, what the brevity
of wit may have to do with that side of wit
exhibited in the playful judgment; besides we do
not know whether wit must satisfy all or only
some of these conditions in order to form real
wit; which of them may be replaced and which
ones are indispensable. We should also like a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>grouping and classification of wit in respect to
its essential attributes. The classification as
given by the authors is based, on the one hand, on
the technical means, and on the other hand, on
the utilization of wit in speech (sound-wit, play
on words, the wit of caricature, characterization
wit, and witty repartee).</p>

<p class='c008'>Accordingly we should not find ourselves in a
dilemma when it comes to pointing out goals for
a further effort to explain wit. In order to look
forward to success we must either introduce new
viewpoints into the work, or try to penetrate
further by concentrating our attention or by
broadening the scope of our interest. We can
prescribe for ourselves the task of at least not
permitting any lack along the latter lines. To
be sure, it is rather remarkable how few examples
of recognized witticisms suffice the authors for
their investigations and how each one accepts
the ones used by his predecessors. We need not
shirk the responsibility of analyzing the same examples
which have already served the classical
authors, but we contemplate new material besides
to lay a broader foundation for our deductions.
It is quite natural that we should select such examples
of wit as objects for our investigation as
have produced the deepest impression upon our
own lives and which have caused us the greatest
amount of laughter.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>Some may inquire whether the subject of wit
is worthy of such effort. In my opinion there is
no doubt about it, for even if I disregard the
personal motives to be revealed during the development
of this theme (the motives which drove
me to gain an insight into the problem of wit),
I can refer to the fact that there is an intimate
connection between all psychic occurrences; a
connection which promises to furnish a psychological
insight into a sphere which, although remote,
will nevertheless be of considerable value
to the other spheres. One may also be reminded
what a peculiar, overwhelmingly fascinating
charm wit offers in our society. A new joke
operates almost as an event of universal interest.
It is passed on from one person to another just
like the news of the latest conquest. Even prominent
men who consider it worth while relating
how they attained fame, what cities and countries
they have seen, and with what celebrated persons
they have consorted, do not disdain to dwell
in their autobiographies upon this and that excellent
joke which they have heard.<a id='r13'></a><a href='#f13' class='c007'><sup>[13]</sup></a></p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>
  <h3 class='c001'>II<br> <span class='c015'>THE TECHNIQUE OF WIT</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c006'>We follow the beckoning of chance and take
up as our first example of wit one which has already
come to our notice in the previous chapter.</p>

<p class='c008'>In that part of the <cite><span lang="no">Reisebilder</span></cite> entitled “<span lang="de">Die
Bäder von Lucca</span>,” Heine introduces the precious
character, Hirsch-Hyacinth, the Hamburg lottery
agent and curer of corns, who, boasting to
the poet of his relationship with the rich Baron
Rothschild, ends thus: “And as true as I pray
that the Lord may grant me all good things I
sat next to Solomon Rothschild, who treated me
just as if I were his equal, quite <em>famillionaire</em>.”</p>

<p class='c008'>It is by means of this excellent and very funny
example that Heymans and Lipps have illustrated
the origin of the comic effect of wit from the succession
of “confusion and clearness.” However,
we shall pass over this question and put to ourselves
the following inquiry: What is it that
causes the speech of Hirsch-Hyacinth to become
witty? It can be only one of two things;
either it is the thought expressed in the sentence
which carries in itself the character of the witticism;
or the witticism adheres to the mode of expression
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>which clothes the thought. On whichever
side the nature of the wit may lie, there we
shall follow it farther and endeavor to elucidate
it.</p>

<p class='c008'>In general a thought may be expressed in different
forms of speech—that is, in different
words—which may repeat it in its original accuracy.
In the speech of Hirsch-Hyacinth we
have before us a definite form of thought expressed
which seems to us especially peculiar and
not very readily comprehensible. Let us attempt
to express as exactly as is possible the same
thought in other words. Lipps, indeed, has already
done this and has thus, to some degree,
elucidated the meaning of the poet. He says (p.
87), “We understand that Heine wishes to say
that the reception was on a familiar basis, that
is, that it was of the friendly sort.” We change
nothing in the sense when we assume a different
interpretation which perhaps fits better into
the speech of Hirsch-Hyacinth: “Rothschild
treated me quite as his equal, in a very <em>familiar</em>
way; that is, as far as this can be done by a
<em>millionaire</em>.” We would only add, “The condescension
of a rich man always carries something
embarrassing for the one experiencing it.”<a id='r14'></a><a href='#f14' class='c007'><sup>[14]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>Whether we shall remain content with this or
with another equivalent formulation of the
thought, we can see that the question which we
have put to ourselves is already answered. The
character of the wit in this example does not
adhere to the thought. It is a correct and ingenious
remark that Heine puts into the mouth
of Hirsch-Hyacinth—a remark of indubitable
bitterness, as is easily understood in the case of
the poor man confronted with so much wealth;
but we should not care to call it witty. Now if
any one who cannot forget the poet’s meaning
in the interpretation should insist that the
thought in itself is also witty, we can refer him
to the definite fact that the witty character is
lost in the interpretation. It is true that Hirsch-Hyacinth’s
speech made us laugh loudly, but
though Lipps’s or our own accurate rendering
may please us and cause us to reflect, yet it cannot
make us laugh.</p>

<p class='c008'>But if the witty character of our example does
not belong to the thought, then it must be sought
for in the form of expression in the wording.
We have only to study the peculiarity of this
mode of expression to realize what one may term
word- or form-technique. Also we may discover
the things that are intimately related to the very
nature of wit, since the character as well as the
effect of wit disappears when one set of expressions
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>is changed for others. At all events we
are in full accord with our authors when we put
so much value upon the verbal form of the wit.
Thus K. Fischer (p. 72) says: “It is, in the first
place, the naked form which is responsible for
the perception of wit, and one is reminded of a
saying of Jean Paul’s which affirms and proves
this nature of wit in the same expression. ‘Thus
the mere position conquers, be it that of warriors
or of sentences.’”</p>

<h4 class='c016'><em>Formation of Mixed Words</em></h4>

<p class='c017'>Now wherein lies the “technique” of this
wit? What has occurred to the thought, in our
own conception, that it became changed into wit
and caused us to laugh heartily? The comparison
of our conception with the text of the poet
teaches us that two processes took place. In the
first place there occurred an important abbreviation.
In order to express fully the thought contained
in the witticism we had to append to the
words “Rothschild treated me just as an equal,
on a familiar basis,” an additional sentence
which in its briefest form reads: i.e., so far as
a millionaire can do this. Even then we feel the
necessity of an additional explanatory sentence.<a id='r15'></a><a href='#f15' class='c007'><sup>[15]</sup></a>
The poet expresses it in terser terms as follows:
“Rothschild treated me just like an equal,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>quite <em>famillionaire</em>.” The entire restriction,
which the second sentence imposes on the first
thus verifying the familiar treatment, has been
lost in the jest. But it has not been so entirely
lost as not to leave a substitute from which it
can be reconstructed. A second change has also
taken place. The word “familiar” in the witless
expression of the thought has been transformed
into “<em>famillionaire</em>” in the text of the
wit, and there is no doubt that the witty character
and ludicrous effect of the joke depends
directly upon this word-formation. The newly
formed word is identical in its first part with
the word “familiar” of the first sentence, and
its terminal syllables correspond to the word
“millionaire” of the second sentence. In this
manner it puts us in a position to conjecture the
second sentence which was omitted in the text
of the wit. It may be described as a composite
of two constituents “familiar” and “millionaire,”
and one is tempted to depict its origin from
the two words graphically.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>FAMIL I  A R</div>
      <div class='line in2'>MILLIONAIRE</div>
      <div class='line'>—————————————</div>
      <div class='line'>FAMILLIONAIRE</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>The process, then, which has carried the
thought into the witticism can be represented in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>the following manner, which, although at first
rather fantastic, nevertheless furnishes exactly
the actual existing result: “Rothschild treated
me quite familiarly, i.e., as well as a millionaire
can do that sort of thing.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Now imagine that a compressing force is acting
upon these sentences and assume that for
some reason or other the second sentence is of
lesser resistance. It is accordingly forced toward
the vanishing point, but its important component,
the word “millionaire,” which strives
against the compressing power, is pushed, as it
were, into the first sentence and becomes fused
with the very similar element, the word “familiar”
of this sentence. It is just this possibility,
provided by chance to save the essential part of
the second sentence, which favors the disappearance
of the other less important components.
The jest then takes shape in this
manner: “Rothschild treated me in a very</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>famillionaire way.”</div>
      <div class='line in7'>/ &#160;  (mili) (aire)</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Apart from such a compressing force, which is
really unknown to us, we may describe the origin
of the wit-formation, that is, the technique of the
wit in this case, as a <em>condensation with substitutive
formation</em>. In our example the substitutive
formation consists in the formation of a mixed
word. This fused word “famillionaire,” incomprehensible
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>in itself but instantly understood
in its context and recognized as senseful,
is now the carrier of the mirth-provoking
stimulus of the jest, whose mechanism, to be
sure, is in no way clearer to us through the
discovery of the technique. To what extent
can a linguistic process of condensation with
substitutive formation produce pleasure through
a fused word and force us to laugh? We
make note of the fact that this is a different
problem, the treatment of which we can postpone
until we shall find access to it later. For
the present we shall continue to busy ourselves
with the technique of wit.</p>

<p class='c008'>Our expectation that the technique of wit cannot
be considered an indifferent factor in the examination
of the nature of wit prompts us to inquire
next whether there are other examples of
wit formed like Heine’s “famillionaire.” Not
many of these exist, but enough to constitute a
small group which may be characterized as the
blend-word formations or fusions. Heine himself
has produced a second witticism from the
word “millionaire” by copying himself, as it
were, when he speaks of a “millionarr” (<cite>Ideen</cite>,
Chap. XIV). This is a visible condensation
of “millionaire” and “narr” (fool) and, like
the first example, expresses a suppressed by-thought.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>Other examples of a similar nature
are as follows.</p>

<p class='c008'>During the war between Turkey and the Balkan
States, in 1912, <cite>Punch</cite> depicted the part
played by Rumania by representing the latter
as a highwayman holding up the members of
the Balkan alliance. The picture was entitled:
<cite>Kleptorumania</cite>. Here the word is a fusion of
Kleptomania and Rumania and may be represented
as follows:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in2'>KLEPTOMANIA</div>
      <div class='line in6'>RUMANIA</div>

      <div class='line'>KLEPTORUMANIA</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>A naughty jest of Europe has rebaptized a
former potentate, Leopold, into <em>Cleopold</em> because
of his relation to a lady surnamed Cleo.
This is a clear form of condensation which by
the addition of a single letter forever vividly
preserves a scandalous allusion.</p>

<p class='c008'>In an excellent chapter on this same theme
Brill gives the following example.<a id='r16'></a><a href='#f16' class='c007'><sup>[16]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>“De Quincey once remarked that old persons
are apt to fall into ‘anecdotage.’” The word
<em>Anecdotage</em>, though in itself incomprehensible,
can be readily analyzed to show its original full
sense; and on analysis we find that it is made up
of two words, <em>anecdote</em> and <em>dotage</em>. That is, instead
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>of saying that old persons are apt to fall
into dotage and that old persons are fond of telling
anecdotes, De Quincey fuses the two words
into a neologism, <em>anecdotage</em>, and thus simultaneously
expresses both ideas. The technique,
therefore, lies in the fusion of the two words.
Such a fusion of words is called condensation.
Condensation is a substitutive formation, i.e., instead
of <em>anecdote</em> and <em>dotage</em> we have <em>anecdotage</em>.</p>

<p class='c008'>“In a short story which I have recently read,
one of the characters, a ‘sport,’ speaks of the
Christmas season as the <em>alcoholidays</em>. By reduction
it can be easily seen that we have here a compound
word, a combination of <em>alcohol</em> and <em>holidays</em>
which can be graphically represented as
follows:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>alcoHOL</div>
      <div class='line in4'>HOLidays</div>
      <div class='line'>————————————</div>
      <div class='line'>ALCOHOLIDAYS</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>“Here the condensation expresses the idea
that holidays are conducive to alcoholic indulgence.
In other words, we have here a fused
word, which, though strange in appearance, can
be easily understood in its proper context. The
witticism may be described as a condensation
with substitution.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The same mechanism is found in the following:
A dramatic critic, summarizing three paragraphs
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>to the effect that most plays now produced
in New York City are violently emotional
and hysterical, remarks: ‘Thespis has taken up
his home in Dramatteawan.’ The last word is
a condensation of <em>drama</em> and <em>Matteawan</em>. The
substitution not only expressed the critic’s idea
that most of the plays at present produced in
New York are violent, emotional and hysterical,
that is insane, but it also contains a clever allusion
to the nature of the problem presented by
most of these plays. Matteawan is a state hospital
for criminal insane. Most of the plays are
not only insane, but also criminal since they treat
of murders, divorces, robberies, scandals, etc.”</p>

<p class='c008'>When Flaubert published his famous romance
<cite>Salammbo</cite>, which treats of life in ancient Carthage,
it was scoffingly referred to by Sainte-Beuve

<p class='c008'>During a conversation with a lady I unintentionally
furnished the material for a jest. I
spoke to her about the great merits of an investigator
whom I considered unjustly ignored. She
remarked, “But the man really deserves a monument.”
“Perhaps he will get one some day,” I
answered, “but at the moment his success is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>very limited.” “Monument” and “moment”
are contrasts. The lady then united these contrasts
and said: “Well, let us wish him a <em>monumentary</em>
success.”</p>

<p class='c008'>If at this stage the reader should become
displeased with a viewpoint which threatens to
destroy his pleasure in wit without explaining
the source of this pleasure I must beg him to
be patient for a while, because we are now confronted
with the technique of wit, the examination
of which promises many revelations if
only we enter into it far enough. Besides the
analysis of the examples thus far cited, which
show simply a process of condensation, there
are others in which the changed expressions
manifest themselves in other ways.</p>

<h4 class='c016'><em>Condensation with Modification and Substitution</em></h4>

<p class='c017'>The following witticisms of Mr. N. will serve
as illustrations.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I was driving with him tête-à-bête.” Nothing
is simpler than the reduction of this jest.
Evidently it can only mean: I was driving
tête-à-tête with Mr. X. and X. is a stupid ass
(beast).</p>

<p class='c008'>Neither of these two sentences is witty nor
is there any wit if one combines them into this
one: “I was out driving tête-à-tête with that
stupid ass (beast).” The wit appears when
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>the words “stupid ass” are omitted and when,
as a substitute for them, the first “t” of the
second “tête” is changed to “b.” This slight
modification brings back to expression the suppressed
“bête.” The technique of this group
of witticisms may be described as “condensation
with a slight modification.” And it would
seem that the more insignificant the substitutive
modification, the better is the wit.</p>

<p class='c008'>Quite similar, although not without its complications,
is the technique of another form of
witticism. During a discussion about a person
in whom there was something to praise and
much to criticise, N. remarked: “Yes, vanity
is one of his four heels of Achilles.”<a id='r17'></a><a href='#f17' class='c007'><sup>[17]</sup></a> This
modification consists in the fact that instead of
the one vulnerable heel which was attributed to
Achilles we have here four heels. Four heels
means four feet and that number is only found
on animals. The two thoughts condensed in
the witticism are as follows: Except for his
vanity he is an admirable fellow; still I do not
care for him, for he is more of an animal than
a human being.<a id='r18'></a><a href='#f18' class='c007'><sup>[18]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>A similar but simpler joke I heard <i><span lang="la">statu
nascendi</span></i> in a family circle. One of two brothers
who were attending college was an excellent
scholar while the other was only an average
student. It so happened that the model boy
had a setback in school. The mother discussed
this matter and expressed her fear lest this event
be the beginning of a lasting deterioration.
The boy who until then had been overshadowed
by his brother willingly grasped this opportunity
to remark: “Yes, Carl is going backward
on all-fours.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Here the modification consists in a small
addition as an assurance that in his judgment
his brother is going backward. This modification
represents and takes the place of a passionate
plea for his own cause which may be
expressed as follows: After all, you must not
think that he is so much cleverer than I am
simply because he has more success in school.
He is really a stupid ass, i.e., much more stupid
than I am.</p>

<p class='c008'>A good illustration of condensation with
slight modification is furnished by a well-known
witty jest of Mr. N., who remarked about a
character in public life that he had a “<em>great
future behind him</em>.” The butt of this joke
was a young man whose ancestry, rearing, and
personal qualities seemed to destine him for the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>leadership of a great party and the attainment
of political power at its head. But times
changed, the party became politically incompetent,
and it could readily be foreseen that the
man who was predestined to become its leader
would come to nothing. The briefest reduction
of the meaning by which one could replace this
joke would be: The man has had a great future
before him, but that is now past. Instead of “has
had” and the appended afterthought there is a
small change in the main sentence in which “before”
is replaced by its opposite “behind.”<a id='r19'></a><a href='#f19' class='c007'><sup>[19]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. N. made use of almost the same modification
in the case of the nobleman who was
appointed minister of agriculture for no other
reason than that he was interested in agriculture.
Public opinion had an opportunity to
find out that he was the most incompetent man
who had ever been intrusted with this office.
When, however, he had relinquished his portfolio
and had withdrawn to his agricultural
pursuits Mr. N. said of him: “<em>Like Cincinnatus
of Old he has returned to his place in front of
the plough.</em>”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>That Roman, who was likewise called to his
office from his farm, returned to his place
behind the plough. In those days, just as in
the present time, in front of the plough walked—the
ox.</p>

<p class='c008'>We could easily increase these examples by
many others, but I am of the opinion that we
are in need of no more cases in order to grasp
thoroughly the character of the technique of
this second group—condensation with modification.
If we now compare the second group
with the first, the technique of which consisted
in condensation with a mixed word-formation,
we readily see that the differences are not vital
and that the lines of demarcation are indistinct.
The mixed word-formation, like the modification,
became subordinated to the idea of substitutive
formation, and if we desire we can
also describe the mixed word-formation as a
modification of the parent word through the
second elements.</p>

<p class='c008'>We may make our first pause here and ask
ourselves with what known factor in the literature
of wit our first result, either in whole or
in part, coincides. It obviously agrees with the
factor of brevity which Jean Paul calls the soul
of wit (<em>supra</em>, p. 11). But brevity alone is not
wit or every laconism would be witty. The
brevity of wit must be of a special kind. We
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>recall that Lipps has attempted to describe
more fully the peculiarity of the brevity of
wit (<em>v. s.</em>, p. 11). Here our investigation started
and demonstrated that the brevity of wit is
often the result of a special process which has
left a second trace—the substitutive formation—in
the wording of the wit. By applying the
process of reduction, which aims to cause a
retrogression in the peculiar process of condensation,
we find also that wit depends only
upon the verbal expression which was produced
by the process of condensation. Naturally our
entire interest now centers upon this peculiar
and hitherto almost neglected mechanism.
Furthermore, we cannot yet comprehend how
it can give origin to all that is valuable in wit;
namely, the resultant pleasure.</p>

<h4 class='c016'><em>Condensation in Dreams</em></h4>

<p class='c017'>Have processes similar to those here described
as the technique of wit already been
noted in another sphere of our psychic life?
To be sure, in one apparently remote sphere.
In 1900 I published a book which, as indicated
by its title (<cite>The Interpretation of Dreams</cite><a id='r20'></a><a href='#f20' class='c007'><sup>[20]</sup></a>),
makes the attempt to explain the riddle of the
dream and to trace the dream to normal psychic
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>operations. I had occasion to contrast there the
manifest and often peculiar dream-content with
the latent but altogether real thoughts of the
dream from which it originated, and I took up
the investigation of the processes which make
the dream from the latent dream-thought. I
also investigated the psychological forces which
participated in this transposition. The sum
of the transforming processes I designated as
the dream-work and, as a part of this dream-work,
I described the process of condensation.
This process has a striking similarity to the
technique of wit and, like the latter, it leads to
abbreviations and brings about substitutive
formations of like character.</p>

<p class='c008'>From recollections of his own dreams the
reader will be familiar with the compositions
of persons and objects that appear in them;
indeed, the dream makes similar compositions
of words which can then be reduced by analysis
(e.g., Autodidasker—Autodidakt and Lasker<a id='r21'></a><a href='#f21' class='c007'><sup>[21]</sup></a>).
On other occasions and even much more frequently,
the condensation work of the dream
produces no compositions, but pictures which
closely resemble an object or person up to a
certain addition or variation which comes from
another source, like the modifications in the
witticisms of Mr. N. We cannot doubt that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>in this case, as in the other, we deal with a
similar psychic process which is recognizable by
identical results. Such a far-reaching analogy
between wit-technique and dream-work will
surely arouse our interest in the former and
stimulate our expectation of finding some explanation
of wit from a comparison with the
dream. We forbear, however, to enter upon
this work by bearing in mind that we have investigated
the technique of wit in only a very
small number of witty jests, so that we cannot
be certain that the analogy, the workings of
which we wish to explore, will hold good.
Hence we turn away from the comparison with
the dream and again take up the technique of
wit, leaving, however, at this place of our investigation
a visible thread, as it were, which
later we shall take up again.</p>

<h4 class='c016'><em>Wit Formed by Word-division</em></h4>

<p class='c017'>The next point we shall discuss is whether the
process of condensation with substitutive formation
is demonstrable in all witticisms so that
it may be designated as a universal character of
the technique of wit. I recall a joke which has
clung to my mind through certain peculiar circumstances.
One of the great teachers of my
youth, whom we considered unable to appreciate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>a joke—he had never told us a single joke of
his own—came into the Institute laughing.
With an unwonted readiness he explained the
cause of his good humor. “I have read an
excellent joke,” he said. “<em>A young man who
claimed to be a relative of the great J. J.
Rousseau, and who bore his name, was introduced
into a Parisian drawing-room. It should
be added that he was decidedly red-headed. He
behaved in such an awkward manner that the
hostess ventured this criticism to the gentleman
who had introduced him—‘Vous m’avez fait connaître
un jeune homme roux et sot, mais non pas
un Rousseau.’</em>”</p>

<p class='c008'>At this point our teacher started to laugh
again. According to the nomenclature of our
authors this is sound-wit and a poor kind at
that, since it plays with a proper name.</p>

<p class='c008'>But what is the technique of this wit? It is
quite clear that the character which we had perhaps
hoped to demonstrate universally leaves us
in the lurch in the first new example. Here
there is no omission and scarcely an abbreviation.
In the witticism the lady expresses almost
everything that we can ascribe to the thoughts.
“You have made me look forward to meeting a
relative of J. J. Rousseau. I expected that he
was perhaps even mentally related to him.
Imagine my surprise to find this red-haired
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>foolish boy, a <i><span lang="fr">roux et sot</span></i>.” To be sure, I was
able to add and insert something, but this
attempt at reduction does not annul the wit.
It remains fixed and attached to the sound
similarity of
<span class='fraction'><span class='under'>Rousseau.</span><br>roux sot</span>
This proves that condensation
with substitution plays no part in
the production of this witticism.</p>

<p class='c008'>With what else do we have to deal? New
attempts at reduction taught me that the joke
will persistently continue until the name Rousseau
is replaced by another. If, e.g., I substitute
the name Racine for it I find that although
the lady’s criticism is just as feasible
as before it immediately loses every trace of wit.
Now I know where I can look for the technique
of this joke although I still hesitate to formulate
it. I shall make the following attempt:
The technique of the witticism lies in the fact
that one and the same word—the name—is
used in a twofold application, once as a whole
and once divided into its syllables like a charade.</p>

<p class='c008'>I can mention a few examples of identical
technique. A witticism of this sort was utilized
by an Italian lady to avenge a tactless remark
made to her by the first Napoleon. Pointing
to her compatriots at a court ball he said:
“<i><span lang="it">Tutti gli Italian danzano si male</span></i>” (all
Italians dance so badly). To which she quickly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>replied: <i>“<span lang="it">Non tutti, ma buona parte</span>”</i> (Not
all, but a great many)—<span class='fraction'><span class='under'><span lang="it">Buona parte</span>.<a id='r22'></a><a href='#f22' class='c007'><sup>[22]</sup></a></span><br><span lang="it">Buonaparte</span>.</span> Brill
reports still another example in which the wit
depends on the twofold application of a name:
“<em>Hood once remarked that he had to be a lively
Hood for a livelihood.</em>”<a id='r23'></a><a href='#f23' class='c007'><sup>[23]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>At one time when Antigone was produced
in Berlin a critic found that the presentation
entirely lacked the character of antiquity. The
wits of Berlin incorporated this criticism in
the following manner: “<em>Antique? Oh, nay</em>”
(Th. Vischer and K. Fischer).</p>

<h4 class='c016'><em>Manifold Application of the Same Material</em></h4>

<p class='c017'>In these examples, which will suffice for this
species of wit, the technique is the same. A
name is made use of twice; first, as a whole, and
then divided into its syllables—and in their
divided state the syllables yield a different
meaning.<a id='r24'></a><a href='#f24' class='c007'><sup>[24]</sup></a> The manifold application of the
same word, once as a whole and then as the
component syllables into which it divides itself,
was the first case that came to our attention
in which technique deviated from that of condensation.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>Upon brief reflection, however, we
must divine from the abundance of examples
that come to us that the newly discovered
technique can hardly be limited to this single
means. Obviously there are any number of
hitherto unobserved possibilities for one to
utilize the same word or the same material of
words in manifold application <em>in one sentence</em>.
May not all these possibilities furnish technical
means for wit? It would seem so, judging
by the following examples.</p>

<p class='c008'>“<em>Two witty statesmen, X and Y, met at a
dinner. X, acting as toastmaster, introduced Y
as follows: ‘My friend, Y, is a very wonderful
man. All you have to do is to open his mouth,
put in a dinner, and a speech appears, etc.’
Responding to the speaker, Y said: ‘My
friend, the toastmaster, told you what a wonderful
man I am, that all you have to do is to
open my mouth, put in a dinner, and a speech
appears. Now let me tell you what a wonderful
man he is. All you have to do is open
anybody’s mouth, put in his speech, and the dinner
appears.’</em>”<a id='r25'></a><a href='#f25' class='c007'><sup>[25]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>In examples of this sort, one can use the
same material of words and simply change
slightly their order. The slighter the change,
the more one gets the impression that different
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>sense was expressed with the same words,
the better is the technical means of wit. And
how simple are the means of its production!
“<em>Put in a dinner and a speech appears—put
in a speech and a dinner appears.</em>” This is
really nothing but an exchange of places of
these two phrases whereby what was said of Y
becomes differentiated from what is said of
X. To be sure, this is not the whole technique
of the joke.<a id='r26'></a><a href='#f26' class='c007'><sup>[26]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>Great latitude is afforded the technique of
wit if one so extends the “<em>manifold application
of the same material</em>” that the word—or the
words—upon which the wit depends may be
used first unchanged and then with a slight
modification. An example is another joke of
Mr. N. He heard a gentleman, who himself
was born a Jew, utter a malicious statement
about Jewish character. “Mr. Councilor,”
said he, “I am familiar with your <em>antesemitism</em>,
but your <em>antisemitism</em> is new to me.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Here only one single letter is changed, the
modification of which could hardly be noticed
in careless pronunciation. This example reminds
one of the other modification jokes of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>Mr. N., but it differs from them in lacking the
condensation. Everything that was to be said
has been told in the joke. “I know that you
yourself were formerly a Jew, therefore I am
surprised that you should rail against the
Jew.”</p>

<p class='c008'>An excellent example of such wit modification
is also the familiar exclamation: “<i><span lang="it">Traduttore—Traditore</span></i>.”<a id='r27'></a><a href='#f27' class='c007'><sup>[27]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>The similarity between the two words, almost
approaching identity, results in a very impressive
representation of the inevitability by
which a translator becomes a transgressor—in
the eyes of the author.</p>

<p class='c008'>The manifoldness of slight modifications possible
in these jokes is so great that none is
quite similar to the other. Here is a joke which
is supposed to have arisen at an examination for
the degree of law. The candidate was translating
a passage from the Corpus juris, “<em>Labeo
ait</em>.” “‘I fall (fail),’ says he,” volunteered
the candidate. “‘You fall (fail),’ says I,” replied
the examiner and the examination ended.
Whoever mistakes the name of the celebrated
Jurist for a word to which he attaches a false
meaning certainly deserves nothing better. But
the technique of the witticism lies in the fact
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>that the examiner used almost the same words
in punishing the applicant which the latter used
to prove his ignorance. Besides, the joke is an
example of repartee whose technique, as we
shall see, is closely allied to the one just
mentioned.</p>

<p class='c008'>Words are plastic and may be moulded into
almost any shape. There are some words which
have lost their true original meaning in certain
usages which they still enjoy in other
applications. In one of Lichtenberg’s jokes
just those conditions have been sought for in
which the nuances of the wordings have removed
their basic meaning.</p>

<p class='c008'><em>“How goes it?” asked the blind of the lame
one. “As you see,” replied the lame one to the
blind.</em></p>

<p class='c008'>Language is replete with words which taken
in one sense are full of meaning and in another
are colorless. There may be two different
derivatives from the same root, one of which
may develop into a word with a full meaning
while the other may become a colorless suffix or
prefix, and yet both may have the same sound.
The similarity of sound between a word having
full meaning and one whose meaning is colorless
may also be accidental. In both cases
the technique of wit can make use of such
relationship of the speech material. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>following examples illustrate some of these
points.</p>

<p class='c008'>“<em>Do you call a man kind who remits nothing
to his family while away?</em>” asked an actor.
“<em>Call that kindness?</em>” “<em>Yes, unremitting
kindness</em>,” was the reply of Douglas Jerrold.
The wit here depends on the first syllable <em>un</em>
of the word <em>unremitting</em>. Un is usually a prefix
denoting “not,” but by adding it to “remitting”
a new relationship is unexpectedly
established which changes the meaning of the
context. “<em>An undertaker is one who always
carries out what he undertakes.</em>” The striking
character upon which the wit here depends
is the manifold application of the words <em>undertaker</em>
and <em>carry out</em>. Undertaker commonly
denotes one who manages funerals. Only when
taken in this sense and using the words <em>carry
out</em> literally is the sentence witty. The wit
lies in the manifold application of the same
words.</p>

<h4 class='c016'><em>Double Meaning and Play on Words</em></h4>

<p class='c017'>If we delve more deeply into the variety of
“manifold application” of the same word we
suddenly notice that we are confronted with
forms of “double meaning” or “plays on
words” which have been known a long time and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>which are universally acknowledged as belonging
to the technique of wit. Then why have we
bothered our brains about discovering something
new when we could just as well have gleaned it
from the most superficial treatise on wit? We
can say in self-defense only that we are presenting
another side of the same phenomena
of verbal expressions. What the authors
call the “playful” character of wit we treat
from the point of view of “manifold application.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Further examples of manifold application
which may also be designated under a new and
third group, the class of double meaning, may
be divided into subdivisions. These, to be sure,
are not essentially differentiated from one another
any more than the whole third group from
the second. In the first place we have:</p>

<p class='c008'>(a) Cases of double meaning of a name and
its verbal significance: e.g., “<em>Discharge thyself
of our company, Pistol</em>” (<cite>Henry IV</cite>, Act
II). “<em>For Suffolk’s duke may he suffocate</em>”
(<cite>Henry IV</cite>, Act I). Heine says, “<em>Here in
Hamburg rules not the rascally Macbeth, but
Banko</em> (Banquo).”</p>

<p class='c008'>In those cases where the unchanged name
cannot be used,—one might say “misused,”—one
can get a double meaning by means of
familiar slight modifications: “<em>Why have the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>French rejected Lohengrin?</em>” was a question
asked some time ago. The answer was, “<em>On
Elsa’s</em> (Alsace) <em>account.</em>”</p>

<p class='c008'>(b) Cases where a double meaning is obtained
by using a word which has both a verbal and
metaphoric sense furnish an abundant source
for the technique of wit. A medical colleague,
who was well known for his wit, once said to
Arthur Schnitzler, the writer: “<em>I am not at all
surprised that you became a great poet. Your
father had already held up the mirror to his
contemporaries.</em>” The mirror used by the
father of the writer, the famous Dr. Schnitzler,
was the laryngoscope. According to the well-known
quotation from <cite>Hamlet</cite> (Act III,
Scene 2), the object of the play as well as
the writer who creates it is to “hold, as’t were,
the mirror up to nature; to show virtue her
own feature, scorn her own image, and the very
age and body of the time his form and pressure.”</p>

<p class='c008'>(c) Cases of actual double meaning or play
on words—the ideal case, as it were, of manifold
application. Here no violence is done to the
word. It is not torn into syllables. It need
not undergo any modifications. It need not
exchange its own particular sphere, say as a
proper name, for another. Thanks to certain
circumstances it can express two meanings just
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>as it stands in the structure of the sentence.
Many examples are at our disposal.</p>

<p class='c008'>One of the first royal acts of the last Napoleon
was, as is well known, the confiscation
of the estates belonging to the House of Orleans.
“<i><span lang="fr">C’est le premier vol de l’aigle</span></i>” was
an excellent play on words current at that time.
“Vol” means both flight and theft. Louis XV
wished to test the wit of one of his courtiers
whose talent in that direction he had heard
about. He seized his first opportunity to command
the cavalier to concoct a joke at his
(the king’s) expense. He wanted to be the
“subject” of the witticism. The courtier answered
him with the clever <em>bonmot</em>, “<i><span lang="fr">Le roi
n’est pas sujet</span>.</i>” “Subject” also means “vassal.”
(Taken from K. Fischer.)</p>

<p class='c008'><em>A physician, leaving the sick-bed of a wife,
whose husband accompanied him, exclaimed
doubtfully: “I do not like her looks.” “I
have not liked her looks for a long time,” was
the quick rejoinder of the husband.</em> The
physician, of course, referred to the condition
of the wife, but he expressed his apprehension
about the patient in such words as to afford
the husband the means of utilizing them to
assert his conjugal aversion. Concerning a
satirical comedy Heine remarked: “<em>This satire
would not have been so biting had the author
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>of it had more to bite.</em>” This jest is a better
example of metaphoric and common double
meaning than of real play upon words, but
at present we are not concerned about such
strict lines of demarcation. <em>Charles Matthews,
the elder, one of England’s greatest actors,
was asked what he was going to do with his
son</em> (the young man was destined for architecture).
“<em>Why</em>,” answered the comedian, “<em>he
is going to draw houses like his father</em>.” <em>Foote
once asked a man why he forever sang one
tune. “Because it haunts me,” replied the man.
“No wonder,” said Foote, “you are continually
murdering it.”</em> Said the Dyspeptic Philosopher:
“<em>One swallow doesn’t make a summer,
nor quench the thirst.</em>”</p>

<p class='c008'><em>A gentleman had shown much ingenuity in
evading a notorious borrower whom he had
sent away many times with the request to call
when he was “in.” One day, however, the
borrower eluded the servant at the door and cornered
his victim.</em></p>

<p class='c008'><em>“Ah,” said the host, seeing there was no way
out of it, “at last I am in.”</em></p>

<p class='c008'><em>“No,” returned the borrower in anticipation,
“at last I am in and you are out.”</em></p>

<p class='c008'>Heine said in the <cite>Harzreise</cite>: “<em>I cannot recall
at the moment the names of all the students,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>and among the professors there are some who
have no name as yet.</em>”</p>

<p class='c008'>Dr. Johnson said of the University of St.
Andrews in Scotland, which was poor in purse,
but prolific in the distribution of its degrees:
“<em>Let it persevere in its present plan and it may
become rich</em> by degrees.” Here the wit depends
more on the manifold application than
on the play on words.</p>

<p class='c008'>The keen-witted writer, Horatio Winslow,
sums up the only too-familiar history of some
American families as follows:</p>

<h4 class='c016'><span class='sc'>A Tale of Two American Generations</span></h4>

<div class='lg-container-b c003'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><em>Gold Mine</em></div>
      <div class='line'><em>Gold Spoon</em></div>
      <div class='line'><em>Gold Cure</em></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>The last couplet, gold cure, refers to the
familiar cure for alcoholism. This wit is an
excellent example of unification—everything is,
as it were, of gold. The manifold meanings
of the adjective which do not very strikingly
contrast with one another make possible this
“manifold application.”</p>

<h4 class='c016'><em>Ambiguity</em></h4>

<p class='c017'>Another play on words will facilitate the
transition to a new subdivision of the technique
of double meaning. The witty colleague who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>was responsible for the joke mentioned on
page 42 is likewise responsible for this joke,
current during the trial of Dreyfus:</p>

<p class='c008'>“<em>This girl reminds me of Dreyfus. The
army does not believe in her innocence.</em>”</p>

<p class='c008'>The word innocence, whose double meaning
furnishes the basis of the witticism, has in one
connection the customary meaning which is the
opposite of guilt or transgression, while in the
other connection it has a sexual sense, the
opposite of which is sexual experience. There
are very many such examples of double meaning
and in each one the point of the joke refers
especially to a sexual sense. The group could
be designated as “ambiguous.” <em>A good example
to illustrate this is the story told of a
wealthy but elderly gentleman who showed
his devotion to a young actress by many lavish
gifts. Being a respectable girl she took the
first opportunity to discourage his attentions by
telling him that her heart was already given
to another man. “I never aspired as high as
that,” was his polite answer.</em></p>

<p class='c008'>If one compares this example of double-meaning-with-ambiguity
with other examples
one cannot help noticing a difference which is
not altogether inconsequential to the technique.
In the joke about “innocence” one meaning of
the word is just as good for our understanding
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>of it as the other. One can really not decide
whether the sexual or non-sexual significance
of the word is more applicable and more
familiar. But it is different with the other
example mentioned. Here the final sense of
the words, “I never aspired as high as that,”
is by far more obtrusive and covers and conceals,
as it were, the sexual sense which could
easily escape the unsuspecting person. In sharp
contrast to this let us examine another example
of double meaning in which there is no attempt
made to veil its sexual significance—e.g., Heine’s
characterization of a complaisant lady: “<em>She
could pass (abschlagen) nothing except her
water.</em>” It sounds like an obscene joke and
the wit in it is scarcely noticed.<a id='r28'></a><a href='#f28' class='c007'><sup>[28]</sup></a> But the
peculiarity that both senses of the double meaning
are not equally manifested can occur also in
witticisms without sexual reference providing
that one sense is more common or that it is
preferred on account of its connection with the
other parts of the sentence (e.g., <i><span lang="fr">c’est le premier
vol de l’aigle</span></i>). All these examples I propose
to call double meaning with allusion.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>We have by this time become familiar with
such a large number of different techniques of
wit that I am afraid we may lose sight of them.

<p class='c008'>This variety causes confusion. It might vex
us because we have devoted so much time to
the consideration of the technical means of wit,
and the stress laid on the forms might possibly
arouse our suspicions that we are overvaluing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>their importance so far as the knowledge of the
nature of wit is concerned. But this conjecture
is met by the one irrefutable fact: namely, that
each time the wit disappears as soon as we
remove the effect that was brought to expression
by these techniques. We are thus directed
to search for the unity in this variety. It must
be possible to bring all these techniques under
one head. As we have remarked before, it is
not difficult to unite the second and third
groups, for the double meaning, the play on
words, is nothing but the ideal case of utilizing
the same material. The latter is here apparently
the more comprehensive conception. The
examples of dividing, changing the order of the
same material, manifold application with slight
modifications (c, d, e)—all these could, without
difficulty, be subordinated under the conception
of double meaning. But what community exists
between the technique of the first group—condensation
with substitutive formation—and
the two other groups—manifold application of
the same material?</p>

<h4 class='c016'><em>The Tendency to Economy</em></h4>

<p class='c017'>It seems to me that this agreement is very
simple and clear. The application of the same
material is only a special case of condensation
and the play on words is nothing but a condensation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>without substitutive formation. Condensation
thus remains as the chief category. A
compressing or—to be more exact—an economic
tendency controls all these techniques.
As Prince Hamlet says: “Thrift, Horatio,
thrift.” It seems to be all a matter of economy.</p>

<p class='c008'>Let us examine this economy in individual
cases. “<i><span lang="fr">C’est le premier vol de l’aigle.</span></i>” That
is, the first flight of the eagle. Certainly, but
it is a depredatious flight. Luckily for the gist
of this joke “vol” signifies flight as well as
depredation. Has nothing been condensed and
economized by this? Certainly, the entire second
thought, and it was dropped without any
substitution. The double sense of the word
“vol” makes such substitution superfluous, or
what is just as correct: The word “vol” contains
the substitution for the repressed thought
without the necessity of supplementing or
varying the first sentence. Therein consists the
benefit of the double meaning.</p>

<p class='c008'>Another example: <em>Gold mine</em>,—<em>gold spoon</em>,
the enormous economy of expression the single
word “gold” produces. It really tells the history
of two generations in the life of some
American families. The father made his fortune
through hard toiling in the gold fields during
the early pioneer days. The son was born
with a golden spoon in his mouth; having been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>brought up as the son of a wealthy man, he becomes
a chronic alcoholic and has to take the
gold cure.</p>

<p class='c008'>Thus there is no doubt that the condensation
in these examples produces economy and we
shall demonstrate that the same is true in all
cases. Where is the economy in such jokes
as “<em>Rousseau</em>—<i><span lang="fr">roux et sot</span></i>,” or “<em>Antigone</em>—<em>antique-oh-nay</em>”
in which we first failed to
find the prime factors in causing us to establish
the technique of the manifold application of the
same material? In these cases condensation
will naturally not cover the ground, but when
we exchange it for the broader conception of
“economy” we find no difficulty. What we
save in such examples as those just given is
quite obvious. We save ourselves the trouble
of making a criticism, of forming a judgment.
Both are contained in the names. The same is
true in the “<em>livelihood</em>” example and the others
thus far analyzed. Where one does not save
much is in the example of “<em>I am in and you
are out</em>,” at least the wording of a new answer is
saved. The wording of the address, “<em>I am in</em>,”
serves also for the answer. It is little, but in
this little lies the wit. The manifold application
of the same words in addressing and answering
surely comes under the heading of economy.
Note how Hamlet sums up the quick succession
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>of the death of his father and the marriage of
his mother:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c018'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in14'>“the funeral baked meats</div>
      <div class='line'>Did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>But before we accept the “tendency to economize”
as the universal character of wit and ask
whence it originates, what it signifies, and how
it gives origin to the resultant pleasure, we shall
concede a doubt which may justly be considered.
It may be true that every technique
of wit shows the tendency to economize in expression,
but the relationship is not reversible.
Not every economy in expression or every
brevity is witty on that account. We once
raised this question when we still hoped to
demonstrate the condensation process in every
witticism and at that we justly objected by
remarking that a laconism is not necessarily
wit. Hence it must be a peculiar form of
brevity and economy upon which the character
of the wit depends, and just as long as we are
ignorant of this peculiarity the discovery of the
common element in the technique of wit will
bring us no nearer a solution. Besides, we have
the courage to acknowledge that the economies
caused by the technique of wit do not impress us
as very much. They remind one of the manner
in which many a housewife economizes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>when she spends time and money to reach a
distant market because the vegetables can there
be had a cent cheaper. What does wit save by
means of its technique? Instead of putting together
a few new words, which, for the most
part, could have been accomplished without any
effort, it goes to the trouble of searching for
the word which comprises both ideas. Indeed,
it must often at first transform the expression
of one of the ideas into an unusual form until
it furnishes an associative connection with the
second thought. Would it not have been
simpler, easier, and really more economical to
express both thoughts as they happen to come
even if no agreement in expression results? Is
not the economy in verbal expression more than
abrogated through the expenditure of intellectual
work? And who economized through it,
whom does it benefit? We can temporarily circumvent
these doubts by leaving them unsolved
until later on. Are we really familiar enough
with all the forms of techniques of wit? It will
surely be safer to gather new examples and
submit them to analysis.</p>

<h4 class='c016'><em>Puns</em></h4>

<p class='c017'>Indeed, we have not yet given consideration
to one of the largest groups into which the
techniques of wit may be divided. In this we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>have perhaps been influenced by the low estimate
in which this form of wit is held. It
embraces those jokes which are commonly called
“puns.” These are generally counted as the
lowest form of wit, perhaps because they are
“cheapest” and can be formed with the least
effort. They really make the least demands on
the technique of expression just as the actual
play on words makes the most. Whereas in
the latter both meanings find expression in the
identical word, and hence usually in a word
used only once, in the pun it is enough if two
words for both meanings resemble each other
through some slight similarity in structure, in
rhythmic consonance, in the community of
several vowels, or in some other similar manner.
The following examples illustrate these points:</p>

<p class='c008'>“We are now fallen into that critical age
wherein <i><span lang="la">censores</span></i> <span lang="la">liberorum</span> are become <i><span lang="la">censores
librorum</span></i>: <i><span lang="la">Lectores</span></i>, <i><span lang="la">Lictores</span></i>.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Professor Cromwell says that Rome in exchanging
her religion changed <em>Jupiter</em> to <em>Jew
Peter</em>.</p>

<p class='c008'><em>It is related that some students wishing to
play a trick on Agassiz, the great naturalist,
constructed an insect made up of parts taken
from different bugs and sent it to him with the
question, “What kind of a bug is this?” His
answer was “Humbug.”</em></p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>Puns are especially fond of modifying one
of the vowels of the word; e.g., Hevesi (<cite><span lang="de">Almanaccando,
Reisen in Italien</span></cite>, p. 87) says of an
Italian poet who was hostile to the German
emperor, but who was, nevertheless, forced to
sing his praises in his hexameters, “<em>Since he
could not exterminate the Cæsars he at least
annihilated the cæsuras</em>.”</p>

<p class='c008'>From the multitude of puns which are at
our disposal it may be of special interest to
us to quote a really poor example for which
Heine (<cite>Book Le Grand</cite>, Chapter V) is responsible.
<em>After parading for a long time before his
lady as an “Indian Prince” the suitor suddenly
lays aside his mask and confesses, “Madam, I
have lied to you. I have never been in Calcutta
any more than that Calcutta roast which
I relished yesterday for lunch.”</em> Obviously the
fault of this witticism lies in the fact that both
words are not merely similar, but identical.
The bird which served as a roast for his lunch
is called so because it comes from, or at least
is supposed to come from, the same city of
Calcutta.</p>

<p class='c008'>K. Fischer has given much attention to this
form of wit and insists upon making a sharp
distinction between it and the “play on words”
(p. 78). “A pun,” he says, “is a bad play on
words, for it does not play with the word as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>a word, but merely as a sound.” The play on
words, however, “transfers itself from the
sound of the word into the word itself.” On
the other hand, he also classifies such jokes as
“famillionaire, Antigone (Antique-Oh-nay),”
etc., with sound-wit. I see no necessity to follow
him in this. In the plays on words, also,
the word serves us only as a sound to which
this or that meaning attaches itself. Here also
usage of language makes no distinction, and
when it treats “puns” with disdain but the play
on words with a certain respect it seems that
these estimations are determined by others as
technical viewpoints. One should bear in mind
the forms of wit which are referred to as puns.
There are persons who have the ability, when
they are in a high-spirited mood, to reply with
a pun for a long time to every sentence addressed
to them. Brill<a id='r29'></a><a href='#f29' class='c007'><sup>[29]</sup></a> relates that at a gathering
some one spoke disparagingly of a certain
drama and wound up by saying, <em>“It was so
poor that the first act had to be rewritten.”
“And now it is rerotten,” added the punster of
the gathering.</em></p>

<p class='c008'>At all events we can already infer from the
controversies about the line of demarcation between
puns and play on words that the former
cannot aid us in finding an entirely new technique
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>of wit. Even if no claims are made for
the pun that it utilizes the manifold application
of the same material, the accent, nevertheless,
falls upon the rediscovering of the familiar and
upon the agreement between both words forming
the pun. Thus the latter is only a subspecies
of the group which reaches its height
in the real play on words.</p>

<h4 class='c016'><em>Displacements</em></h4>

<p class='c017'>There are some witticisms, however, whose
techniques baffle almost every attempt to classify
them under any of the groups so far investigated.
<em>It is related that while Heine and the
poet Soulié were once chatting together in a
Parisian drawing-room, there entered one of
those Parisians whom one usually compared to
Midas, but not alone on account of their money.
He was soon surrounded by a crowd which
treated him with the greatest deference. “Look
over there,” said Soulié to Heine, “and see
how the nineteenth century is worshipping the
Golden Calf.” Heine cast one glance upon the
object of adoration and replied, as if correcting
his friend: “Oh, he must be older than
that”</em> (K. Fischer, p. 82).</p>

<p class='c008'>Wherein lies the technique of this excellent
witticism? According to K. Fischer it lies in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>the play on words. Thus, for example, he says,
“the words ‘Golden Calf’ may signify Mammon
as well as idol-worship,—in the first case
the gold is paramount; in the second case it is
the animal picture. It may likewise serve to
designate in a rather uncomplimentary way one
who has very much money and very little
brains.” If we apply the test and take away
the expression “Golden Calf” we naturally
also abrogate the wit. We then cause Soulié
to say, “Just see how the people are thronging
about that blockhead only because he is
rich.” To be sure, this is no longer witty. Nor
would Heine’s answer be possible under these
circumstances. But let us remember that it is
not at all a matter of Soulié’s witty comparison,
but of Heine’s retort, which is surely much
more witty. We have then no right to disturb
the phrase “the golden calf” which remains
as a basis for Heine’s words and the
reduction can only be applied to the latter. If
we dilate upon the words, “Oh, he must be
older than that,” we can only proceed as follows:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, he is no longer a calf; he is already a
full-grown ox.” Heme’s wit is therefore based
on the fact that he no longer took the “golden
calf” metaphorically, but personally by referring
it to the moneyed individual himself. If
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>this double meaning is not already contained
in the opinion of Soulié!</p>

<p class='c008'>Let us see. We believe that we can state
that this reduction has not altogether destroyed
Heine’s joke, but, on the contrary, it has left
its essential element untouched. It reads as if
Soulié were now saying, “Just see how the
nineteenth century is worshipping the golden
calf,” and as if Heine were retorting, “Oh, he
is no longer a calf. He is already an ox.” And
even in this reduced form it is still a witticism.
However, another reduction of Heine’s words
is not possible.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is a pity that this excellent example contains
such complicated technical conditions.
And as it cannot aid us toward enlightenment
we shall leave it to search for another in which
we imagine we can perceive a relationship with
the former one.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is a “bath” joke treating of the dread which
some Jews are said to have for bathing. We demand
no patent of nobility for our examples
nor do we make inquiries about their origin.
The only qualifications we require are that they
should make us laugh and serve our theoretical
interest. It is to be remarked that both these
demands are satisfied best by Jewish jokes.</p>

<p class='c008'><em>Two Jews meet near a bathing establishment.
“Have you taken a bath?” asked one. “How
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>is that?” replies the other. “Is one missing?”</em></p>

<p class='c008'>When one laughs very heartily about a joke
he is not in the best mood to investigate its
technique. It is for this reason that some
difficulties are experienced in delving into their
analyses. “That is a comic misunderstanding”
is the thought that comes to us. Yes, but how
about the technique of this joke? Obviously
the technique lies in the double meaning of the
word <em>take</em>. In the first case the word is used
in a colorless idiomatic sense, while in the second
it is the verb in its full meaning. It is,
therefore, a case where the same word is taken
now in the “full” and now in the “empty”
sense (Group II, f). And if we replace the
expression “take a bath” by the simpler
equivalent “bathed” the wit disappears. The
answer is no longer fitting. The joke, therefore,
lies in the expression “take a bath.”</p>

<p class='c008'>This is quite correct, yet it seems that in
this case, also, the reduction was applied in
the wrong place, for the joke does not lie in
the question, but in the answer, or rather in the
counter question: “How is that? Is there
one missing?” Provided the same is not destroyed
the answer cannot be robbed of its wit
by any dilation or variation. We also get the
impression that in the answer of the second
Jew the overlooking of the bath is more significant
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>than the misconception of the word “take.”
However, here, too, things do not look quite
clear and we will, therefore, look for a third
example.</p>

<p class='c008'>Once more we shall resort to a Jewish joke
in which, however, the Jewish element is incidental
only. Its essence is universally human.
It is true that this example, too, contains undesirable
complications, but luckily they are
not of the kind so far which have kept us from
seeing clearly.</p>

<p class='c008'><em>In his distress a needy man borrowed twenty-five
dollars from a wealthy acquaintance. The
same day he was discovered by his creditor in a
restaurant eating a dish of salmon with mayonnaise.
The creditor reproached him in these
words: “You borrow money from me and then
order salmon with mayonnaise. Is that what
you needed the money for?” “I don’t understand
you,” responded the debtor, “when I have
no money I can’t eat salmon with mayonnaise.
When I have money I mustn’t eat it. Well
then, when shall I ever eat salmon with mayonnaise?”</em></p>

<p class='c008'>Here we no longer discover any double meaning.
Even the repetition of the words “salmon
with mayonnaise” cannot contain the technique
of the witticism, as it is not the “manifold application
of the same material,” but an actual,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>identical repetition required by the context.
We may be temporarily nonplussed in this
analysis, and, as a pretext, we may wish to dispute
the character of the wit in the anecdote
which causes us to laugh. What else worthy
of notice can be said about the answer of the
poor man? It may be supposed that the striking
thing about it is its logical character, but,
as a matter of fact, the answer is illogical. The
debtor endeavors to justify himself for spending
the borrowed money on luxuries and asks, with
some semblance of right, when he is to be allowed
to eat salmon. But this is not at all
the correct answer. The creditor does not blame
him for eating salmon on the day that he borrowed
the money, but reminds him that in his
condition he has no right to think of such luxuries
at all. The poor <em>bon vivant</em> disregards
this only possible meaning of the reproach,
centers his answer about another point, and acts
as if he did not understand the reproach.</p>

<p class='c008'>Is it possible that the technique of this joke
lies in this deviation of the answer from the
sense of reproach? A similar changing of the
viewpoint—displacement of the psychic accent—may
perhaps also be demonstrated in the two
previous examples which we felt were related
to this one. This can be successfully shown
and solves the technique of these examples.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>Soulié calls Heine’s attention to the fact that
society worships the “golden calf” in the nineteenth
century just as the Jewish nation once
did in the desert. To this an answer from
Heine like the following would seem fit: “Yes,
that is human nature. Centuries have changed
nothing in it;” or he might have remarked
something equally apposite. But Heine deviates
in his manner from the instigated thought.
Indeed, he does not answer at all. He makes
use of the double meaning found in the phrase
“golden calf” to go off at a tangent. He seizes
upon one of the components of the phrase,
namely, “the calf,” and answers as if Soulié’s
speech placed the emphasis on it—“Oh, he is
no longer a calf, etc.”<a id='r30'></a><a href='#f30' class='c007'><sup>[30]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>The deviation is much more evident in the
bath joke. This example requires a graphic
representation. The first Jew asks, “Have
you taken a <em>bath</em>?” The emphasis lies upon
the bath element. The second answers as if the
query were: “Have you <em>taken</em> a bath?” The
displacement would have been impossible if
the question had been: “Have you bathed?”
The witless answer would have been: “Bathed?
What do you mean? I don’t know what that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>means.” However, the technique of the wit lies
in the displacement of the emphasis from “to
bathe” to “to take.”<a id='r31'></a><a href='#f31' class='c007'><sup>[31]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>Let us return to the example “salmon with
mayonnaise,” which is the purest of its kind.
What is new in it will direct us into various
paths. In the first place we have to give
the mechanism of this newly discovered technique.
I propose to designate it as having
<em>displacement</em> for its most essential element.
The deviation of the trend of thought consists
in displacing the psychic accent to another
than the original theme. It is then incumbent
upon us to find out the relationship of the
technique of displacement to the expression of
the witticism. Our example (salmon with
mayonnaise) shows us that the displacement
technique is absolutely independent of the verbal
expression. It does not depend upon words,
but upon the mental trend, and to abrogate it
we are not helped by substitution so long as
the sense of the answer is adhered to. The reduction
is possible only when we change the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>mental trend and permit the gastronomist to
answer directly to the reproach which he eluded
in the conception of the joke. The reduced
conception will then be: “What I like I cannot
deny myself, and it is all the same to me where
I get the money for it. Here you have my
explanation as to why I happen to be eating
salmon with mayonnaise to-day just after you
have loaned me some money.” But that would
not be  witticism but a <em>cynicism</em>. It will be
instructive to compare this joke with one
which is closely allied to it in meaning.</p>

<p class='c008'><em>A man who was addicted to drink supported
himself in a small city by giving lessons. His
vice gradually became known and he lost most
of his pupils in consequence. A friend of his
took it upon himself to admonish him to reform.
“Look here,” he said, “you could have
the best scholars in town if you would give up
drinking. Why not do it?” “What are you
talking about?” was the indignant reply. “I
am giving lessons in order to be able to drink.
Shall I give up drinking in order to obtain
scholars?”</em></p>

<p class='c008'>This joke, too, carries the stamp of logic
which we have noted in the case of “salmon
with mayonnaise,” but it is no longer displacement-wit.
The answer is a direct one. The
cynicism, which is veiled there, is openly admitted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>here, “For me drink is the most important
thing.” The technique of this witticism
is really very poor and cannot explain its
effect. It lies merely in the change in order
of the same material, or to be more exact, in
the reversal of the means-and-end relationship
between drink and giving lessons or getting
scholars. As I gave no greater emphasis in
the reduction to this factor of the expression
the witticism is somewhat blurred; it may be
expressed as follows: “What a senseless demand
to make. For me, drink is the most important
thing and not the scholars. Giving
lessons is only a means towards more drink.”
The wit is really dependent upon the expression.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the bath wit, the dependence of the witticism
upon the wording “have you taken a
bath” is unmistakable and a change in the
wording nullifies the joke. The technique in
this case is quite complicated. It is a combination
of double meaning (sub-group f) and
displacement. The wording of the question
admits a double meaning. The joke arises
from the fact that the answer is given not in
the sense expected by the questioner, but has a
different subordinate sense. By making the
displacement retrogressive we are accordingly
in position to find a reduction which leaves the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>double meaning in the expression and still does
away with the wit.</p>

<p class='c008'><em>“Have you taken a bath?” “Taken what?
A bath? What is that?”</em> But that is no longer
a witticism. It is simply either a spiteful or
playful exaggeration.</p>

<p class='c008'>In Heme’s joke about the “golden calf” the
double meaning plays a quite similar part. It
makes it possible for the answer to deviate from
the instigated stream of thought—a thing which
happens in the joke about “salmon and mayonnaise”—without
any such dependence upon the
wording. In the reduction Soulié’s speech and
Heine’s answer would be as follows: “It reminds
one very much of the worship of the
golden calf when one sees the people throng
around that man simply because he is rich.”
Heine’s answer would be: “That he is made
so much of on account of his wealth is not the
worst part. You do not emphasize enough the
fact that his ignorance is forgiven on account
of his wealth.” Thus, while the double meaning
would be retained the displacement-wit
would be eliminated.</p>

<p class='c008'>Here we may be prepared for the objection
which might be raised, namely, that we are
seeking to tear asunder these delicate differentiations
which really belong together. Does
not every double meaning furnish occasion for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>displacement and for a deviation of the stream
of thought from one sense to another? And
shall we agree that a “double meaning” and
“displacement” should be designated as representatives
of two entirely different types of
wit? It is true that a relation between double
meaning and displacement actually exists, but
it has nothing to do with our differentiation
of the techniques of wit. In cases of double
meaning the wit contains nothing but a word
capable of several interpretations which allows
the hearer to find the transition from one
thought to another, and which with a little
forcing may be compared to a displacement.
In the cases of displacement-wit, however, the
witticism itself contains a stream of thought
in which the displacement is brought about.
Here the displacement belongs to the work
which is necessary for its understanding.
Should this differentiation not be clear to us we
can make use of the reduction method, which is
an unfailing way for tangible demonstration.
We do not deny, however, that there is something
in this objection. It calls our attention
to the fact that we cannot confuse the psychic
processes in the formation of wit (the wit-work)
with the psychic processes in the conception of
the wit (the understanding-work). The object
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>of our present investigation will be confined
only to the former.<a id='r32'></a><a href='#f32' class='c007'><sup>[32]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>Are there still other examples of the technique
of displacement? They are not easily
found, but the following witticism is a very
good specimen. It also shows a lack of overemphasized
logic found in our former examples.</p>

<p class='c008'><em>A horse-dealer in recommending a saddle
horse to his client said: “If you mount this
horse at four o’clock in the morning you will
be in Monticello at six-thirty in the morning.”
“What will I do in Monticello at six-thirty in
the morning?” asked the client.</em></p>

<p class='c008'>Here the displacement is very striking. The
horse-dealer mentions the early arrival in the
small city only with the obvious intention of
proving the efficiency of the horse. The client
disregards the capacity of the animal, about
which he evidently has no more doubts, and
takes up only the data of the example selected
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>for the test. The reduction of this joke is comparatively
simple.</p>

<p class='c008'>More difficulties are encountered by another
example, the technique of which is very obscure.
It can be solved, however, through the application
of double meaning with displacement. The
joke relates the subterfuge employed by a
“schadchen” (Jewish marriage broker). It
belongs to a class which will claim more of our
attention later.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>The “<span lang="de">schadchen</span>” had assured the suitor
that the father of the girl was no longer living.
After the engagement had been announced the
news leaked out that the father was still living
and serving a sentence in prison. The suitor
reproached the agent for deceiving him.
“Well,” said the latter, “what did I tell you?
Do you call that living?”</i></p>

<p class='c008'>The double meaning lies in the word “living,”
and the displacement consists in the fact that
the “schadchen” avoids the common meaning
of the word, which is a contrast to “death,” and
uses it in the colloquial sense: “You don’t call
that living.” In doing this he explains his
former utterance as a double meaning, although
this manifold application is here quite out of
place. Thus far the technique resembles that
of the “golden calf” and the “bath” jokes.
Here, however, another factor comes into consideration
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>which disturbs the understanding of
the technique through its obtrusiveness. One
might say that this joke is a “characterization-wit.”
It endeavors to illustrate by example the
marriage agent’s characteristic admixture of
mendacious impudence and repartee. We shall
learn that this is only the “show-side” of the
façade of the witticism, that is, its sense. Its
object serves a different purpose. We shall
also defer our attempt at reduction.<a id='r33'></a><a href='#f33' class='c007'><sup>[33]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>After these complicated examples, which are
not at all easy to analyze, it will be gratifying
to find a perfectly pure and transparent example
of “displacement-wit.” <em>A beggar implored
the help of a wealthy baron for a trip
to Ostend, where he asserted the physicians had
ordered him to take sea baths for his health.
“Very well, I shall assist you,” said the rich
baron, “but is it absolutely necessary for you to
go to Ostend, which is the most expensive of all
watering-places?” “Sir,” was the reproving
reply, “nothing is too expensive for my health.”</em>
Certainly that is a proper attitude, but hardly
proper for the supplicant. The answer is given
from the viewpoint of a rich man. The beggar
acts as if it were his own money that he was
willing to sacrifice for his health, as if money
and health concerned the <em>same</em> person.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>
  <h4 class='c016'><em>Nonsense as a Technical Means</em></h4>
</div>

<p class='c017'>Let us take up again in this connection the
instructive example of “salmon with mayonnaise.”
It also presents to us a side in which
we noticed a striking display of logical work
and we have learned from analyzing it that
this logic concealed an error of thought, namely,
a displacement of the stream of thought.
Henceforth, even if only by way of contrast
association, we shall be reminded of other jokes
which, on the contrary, present clearly something
contradictory, something nonsensical, or
foolish. We shall be curious to discover wherein
the technique of the witticism lies. I shall
first present the strongest and at the same time
the purest example of the entire group. Once
more it is a Jewish joke.</p>

<p class='c008'><em>Ike was serving in the artillery corps. He
was seemingly an intelligent lad, but he was
unwieldy and had no interest in the service.
One of his superiors, who was kindly disposed
toward him, drew him aside and said to him:
“Ike, you are out of place among us. I would
advise you to buy a cannon and make yourself
independent.”</em></p>

<p class='c008'>The advice, which makes us laugh heartily,
is obvious nonsense. There are no cannon to
be bought and an individual cannot possibly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>make himself independent as a fighting force
or establish himself, as it were. One cannot
remain one minute in doubt but that this advice
is not pure nonsense, but witty nonsense
and an excellent joke. By what means does
the nonsense become a witticism?</p>

<p class='c008'>We need not meditate very long. From the
discussions of the authors in the Introduction
we can guess that sense lurks in such witty
nonsense, and that this sense in nonsense transforms
nonsense into wit. In our example the
sense is easily found. The officer who gives
the artilleryman, Ike, the nonsensical advice
pretends to be stupid in order to show Ike how
stupidly he is acting. He imitates Ike as if to
say, “I will now give you some advice which is
exactly as stupid as you are.” He enters into
Ike’s stupidity and makes him conscious of it by
making it the basis of a proposition which must
meet with Ike’s wishes, for if Ike owned a cannon
and took up the art of warfare on his own
account, of what advantage would his intelligence
and ambition be to him? How would
he take care of the cannon and acquaint
himself with its mechanism in order to meet
the competition of other possessors of cannon?</p>

<p class='c008'>I am breaking off the analysis of this example
to show the same sense in nonsense in a shorter
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>and simpler, though less glaring case of nonsense-wit.</p>

<p class='c008'>“<em>Never to be born would be best for mortal
man.</em>” “<em>But</em>,” added the sages of the <cite><span lang="de">Fliegende
Blätter</span></cite>, “<em>hardly one man in a hundred thousand
has this luck</em>.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The modern appendix to the ancient philosophical
saying is pure nonsense, and becomes
still more stupid through the addition of the
seemingly careful “hardly.” But this appendix
in attaching itself to the first sentence incontestably
and correctly limits it. It can thus
open our eyes to the fact that that piece of
wisdom so reverently scanned, is neither more
nor less than sheer nonsense. He who is not
born of woman is not mortal; for him there
exists no “good” and no “best.” The nonsense
of the joke, therefore, serves here to expose
and present another bit of nonsense as in the
case of the artilleryman. Here I can add a
third example which, owing to its context,
scarcely deserves a detailed description. It
serves, however, to illustrate the use of nonsense
in wit in order to represent another element
of nonsense.</p>

<p class='c008'><em>A man about to go upon a journey intrusted
his daughter to his friend, begging him to watch
over her chastity during his absence. When
he returned some months later he found that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>she was pregnant. Naturally he reproached
his friend. The latter alleged that he could not
explain this unfortunate occurrence. “Where
has she been sleeping?” the father finally asked.
“In the same room with my son,” replied the
friend. “How is it that you allowed her to
sleep in the same room with your son after I
had begged you so earnestly to take good care
of her?” remonstrated the father. “Well,”
explained the friend, “there was a screen between
them. There was your daughter’s bed
and over there was my son’s bed and between
them stood the screen.” “And suppose he
went behind the screen? What then?” asked
the parent. “Well, in that case,” rejoined the
friend thoughtfully, “it might be possible.”</em></p>

<p class='c008'>In this joke—aside from the other qualities
of this poor witticism—we can easily get the
reduction. Obviously, it would read like this:
“You have no right to reproach me. How
could you be so foolish as to leave your daughter
in a house where she must live in the constant
companionship of a young man? As if it were
possible for a stranger to be responsible for
the chastity of a maiden under such circumstances!”
The seeming stupidity of the friend
here also serves as a reflection of the stupidity
of the father. By means of the reduction we
have eliminated the nonsense contained in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>witticism as well as the witticism itself. We
have not gotten rid of the “nonsense” element
itself, as it finds another place in the context of
the sentence after it has been reduced to its
true meaning.</p>

<p class='c008'>We can now also attempt the reduction of
the joke about the cannon. The officer might
have said: “I know, Ike, that you are an intelligent
business man, but I must tell you that
you are very stupid if you do not realize that
one cannot act in the army as one does in
business, where each one is out for himself
and competes with the other. Military service
demands subordination and co-operation.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The technique of the nonsense-witticisms
hitherto discussed really consists in advancing
something apparently absurd or nonsensical
which, however, discloses a sense serving to
illustrate and represent some other actual
absurdity and nonsense.</p>

<p class='c008'>Has the employment of contradiction in the
technique of wit always this meaning? Here is
another example which answers this affirmatively.
On an occasion when Phocion’s speech
was applauded he turned to his friends and
asked: “<em>Did I say something foolish?</em>”</p>

<p class='c008'>This question seems paradoxical, but we
immediately comprehend its meaning. “What
have I said that has pleased this stupid crowd?
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>I ought really to be ashamed of the applause,
for if it appealed to these fools, it could not
have been very clever after all.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Other examples teach us that absurdity is
used very often in the technique of wit without
serving at all the purpose of uncovering another
piece of nonsense.</p>

<p class='c008'><em>A well-known university teacher who was
wont to spice richly with jokes his rather dry
specialty was once congratulated upon the
birth of his youngest son, who was bestowed
upon him at a rather advanced age. “Yes,”
said he to the well-wishers, “it is remarkable
what mortal hands can accomplish.”</em> This reply
seems especially meaningless and out of place,
for children are called the blessings of God to
distinguish them from creations of mortal hands.
But it soon dawns upon us that this answer has
a meaning and an obscene one at that. The
point in question is not that the happy father
wishes to appear stupid in order to make something
else or some other persons appear stupid.
The seemingly senseless answer causes us astonishment.
It puzzles us, as the authors would
have it. We have seen that the authors deduce
the entire mechanism of such jokes from the
change of the succession of “clearness and confusion.”
We shall try to form an opinion about
this later. Here we content ourselves by remarking
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>that the technique of this witticism
consists in advancing such confusing and senseless
elements.</p>

<p class='c008'>An especially peculiar place among the nonsense-jokes
is assumed by this joke of Lichtenberg.</p>

<p class='c008'>“<em>He was surprised that the two holes were
cut in the pelts of cats just where their eyes
were located.</em>” It is certainly foolish to be
surprised about something that is obvious in
itself, something which is really the explanation
of an identity. It reminds one of a seriously
intended utterance of Michelet (<cite>The Woman</cite>)
which, as I remember it, runs as follows: “<em>How
beautifully everything is arranged by nature.
As soon as the child comes into the world it
finds a mother who is ready to care for it.</em>”
This utterance of Michelet is really silly, but
the one of Lichtenberg is a witticism, which
makes use of the absurdity for some purpose.
There is something behind it. What? At
present that is something we cannot discuss.</p>

<h4 class='c016'><em>Sophistic Faulty Thinking</em></h4>

<p class='c017'>We have learned from two groups of examples
that the wit-work makes use of deviations
from normal thought, namely, <em>displacement</em>
and <em>absurdity</em>, as technical means of presenting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>witty expressions. It is only just to
expect that other faulty thinking may find a
similar application. Indeed, a few examples of
this sort can be cited.</p>

<p class='c008'><em>A gentleman entered a shop and ordered a
fancy cake, which, however, he soon returned,
asking for some liqueur in its stead. He drank
the liqueur, and was about to leave without
paying for it. The shopkeeper held him back.
“What do you want of me?” he asked.
“Please pay for the liqueur,” said the shopkeeper.
“But I have given you the fancy cake
for it.” “Yes, but you have not paid for that
either.” “Well, neither have I eaten it.”</em></p>

<p class='c008'>This little story also bears the semblance of
logic which we already know as the suitable
façade for faulty thinking. The error, obviously,
lies in the fact that the cunning customer
establishes a connection between the return
of the fancy cake and its exchange for the
liqueur, a connection which really does not
exist. The state of affairs may be divided into
two processes which as far as the shopkeeper
is concerned are independent of each other.
He first took the fancy cake and returned it,
so that he owes nothing for it. He then took
the liqueur, for which he owes money. One
might say that the customer uses the relation
“for it” in a double sense, or, to speak more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>correctly, by means of a double sense he forms
a relation which does not hold in reality.<a id='r34'></a><a href='#f34' class='c007'><sup>[34]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>The opportunity now presents itself for making
a not unimportant confession. We are
here busying ourselves with an investigation of
technique of wit by means of examples, and
we ought to be sure that the examples which
we have selected are really true witticisms.
The facts are, however, that in a series of
cases we fall into doubt as to whether or not
the example in question may be called a joke.
We have no criterion at our disposal before
investigation itself furnishes one. Usage of
language is unreliable and is itself in need of
examination for its authority. To decide the
question we can rely on nothing else but a
certain “feeling,” which we may interpret by
saying that in our judgment the decision follows
certain criteria which are not yet accessible
to our knowledge. We shall naturally not
appeal to this “feeling” for substantial proof.
In the case of the last-mentioned example we
cannot help doubting whether we may present
it as a witticism, as a sophistical witticism, or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>merely as a sophism. The fact is that we do
not yet know wherein the character of wit lies.</p>

<p class='c008'>On the other hand the following example,
which evinces, as it were, the complementary
faulty thinking, is a witticism without any
doubt. Again it is a story of a marriage agent.
<em>The agent is defending the girl he has proposed
against the attacks of her prospective fiancé.
“The mother-in-law does not suit me,” the
latter remarks. “She is a crabbed, foolish person.”
“That’s true,” replies the agent, “but
you are not going to marry the mother-in-law,
but the daughter.” “Yes, but she is no longer
young, and she is not pretty, either.” “That’s
nothing: if she is not young or pretty you can
trust her all the more.” “But she hasn’t much
money.” “Why talk of money? Are you going
to marry money? You want a wife, don’t
you?” “But she is a hunchback.” “Well,
what of that? Do you expect her to have no
blemishes at all?”</em></p>

<p class='c008'>It is really a question of an ugly girl who is
no longer young, who has a paltry dowry and a
repulsive mother, and who is besides equipped
with a pretty bad deformity, relations which are
not at all inviting to matrimony. The marriage
agent knows how to present each individual
fault in a manner to cause one to become
reconciled to it, and then takes up the unpardonable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>hunch back as the one fault which
can be excused in any one. Here again there
is the semblance of logic which is characteristic
of sophisms, and which serves to conceal the
faulty thinking. It is apparent that the girl
possesses nothing but faults, many of which
can be overlooked, but one that cannot be passed
by. The chances for the marriage become very
slim. The agent acts as if he removed each
individual fault by his evasions, forgetting that
each leaves behind some depreciation which is
added to the next one. He insists upon dealing
with each factor individually, and refuses to
combine them into a sum total.</p>

<p class='c008'>A similar omission forms the nucleus of another
sophism which causes much laughter,
though one can well question its right to be
called a joke.</p>

<p class='c008'><em>A. had borrowed a copper kettle from B., and
upon returning it was sued by B. because it had
a large hole which rendered it unserviceable.
His defense was this</em>: “<em>In the first place I
never borrowed any kettle from B., secondly
the kettle had a hole in it when I received it
from B., thirdly the kettle was in perfect condition
when I returned it.</em>” Each separate protest
is good by itself, but taken together they
exclude each other. A. treats individually
what must be taken as a whole, just as the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>marriage agent when he deals with the imperfections
of the bride. One can also say that A.
uses “and” where only an “either—or” is
possible.</p>

<p class='c008'>Another sophism greets us in the following
marriage agent story. <em>The suitor objects because
the bride has a short leg and therefore
limps. The agent contradicts him. “You are
wrong,” he says. “Suppose you marry a
woman whose legs are sound and straight.
What do you gain by it? You are not sure
from day to day that she will not fall down,
break a leg, and then be lame for the rest of
her life. Just consider the pain, the excitement,
and the doctor’s bill. But if you marry
this one nothing can happen. Here you have
a finished job.”</em></p>

<p class='c008'>Here the semblance of logic is very shallow,
for no one will by any means admit that a
“finished misfortune” is to be preferred to a
mere possibility of such. The error in the
stream of thought will be seen more easily in a
second example.</p>

<p class='c008'><em>In the temple of Cracow sat the great Rabbi
N. praying with his disciples. Suddenly he
emitted a cry and in response to his troubled
disciples said: “The great Rabbi L. died just
now in Lemberg.” The congregation thereupon
went into mourning for the deceased. In the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>course of the next day travelers from Lemberg
were asked how the rabbi had died, and what
had caused his death. They knew nothing
about the event, however, as, they said, they
had left him in the best of health. Finally it
was definitely ascertained that the Rabbi of
Lemberg had not died at the hour on which
Rabbi N. had felt his death telepathically, and
that he was still living. A stranger seized the
opportunity to banter a pupil of the Cracow
rabbi about the episode. “That was a glorious
exhibition that your rabbi made of himself
when he saw the Rabbi of Lemberg die,” he
said. “Why, the man is still living!” “No
matter,” replied the pupil. “To look from
Cracow to Lemberg was wonderful anyhow.”</em></p>

<p class='c008'>Here the faulty thinking common to both
of the last examples is openly shown. The
value of fanciful ideas is unfairly matched
against reality; possibility is made equivalent
to actuality. To look from Cracow to Lemberg
despite the miles between would have been
an imposing telepathic feat had it resulted in
some truth, but the disciple gives no heed to
that. It might have been possible that the
Rabbi of Lemberg had died at the moment
when the Rabbi of Cracow had proclaimed his
death, but the pupil displaces the accent from
the condition under which the teacher’s act
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>would be remarkable to the unconditional admiration
of this act. “<i><span lang="la">In magnis rebus voluisse
sat est</span></i>” is a similar point of view. Just as in
this example reality is sacrificed in favor of
possibility, so in the foregoing example the
marriage agent suggests to the suitor that the
possibility of the woman’s becoming lame
through an accident is a far more important
consideration to be taken into account; whereas
the question as to whether or not she is lame
is put altogether into the background.</p>

<h4 class='c016'><em>Automatic Errors of Thought</em></h4>

<p class='c017'>Another interesting group attaches itself to
this one of sophistical faulty thinking, a group
in which the faulty thinking may be designated
as <em>automatic</em>. It is perhaps only a stroke of
fate that all of the examples which I shall cite
for this new group are again stories referring
to marriage agents.</p>

<p class='c008'><em>The agent brought along an assistant to a
conference about a bride. This assistant was
to confirm his assertions. “She is as well made
as a pine tree,” said the agent. “Like a pine
tree,” repeated the echo. “She has eyes which
one must appreciate.” “Wonderful eyes,” confirmed
the echo. “She is cultured beyond
words. She possesses extraordinary culture.”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>“Wonderfully cultured,” repeated the assistant.
“However, one thing is true,” confessed the
agent. “She has a slight hunch on her back.”
“And what a hunch!” confirmed the echo.</em></p>

<p class='c008'>The other stories are quite analogous to this
one, but they are cleverer.</p>

<p class='c008'><em>On being introduced to his prospective bride
the suitor was rather unpleasantly surprised,
and drawing aside the marriage agent he reproachfully
whispered to him: “Why have you
brought me here? She is ugly and old. She
squints, has bad teeth, and bleary eyes.”
“You can talk louder,” interrupted the agent.
“She is deaf, too.”</em></p>

<p class='c008'><em>A prospective bridegroom made his first call
on his future bride in company with the agent,
and while in the parlor waiting for the appearance
of the family the agent drew the young
man’s attention to a glass closet containing a
handsome silver set. “Just look at these
things,” he said. “You can see how wealthy
these people are.” “But is it not possible that
these articles were just borrowed for the occasion,”
inquired the suspicious young man, “so
as to give the appearance of wealth?” “What
an idea,” answered the agent protestingly.
“Who in the world would lend them anything?”</em></p>

<p class='c008'>In all three cases one finds the same thing.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>A person who reacts several times in succession
in the same manner continues in the same
manner on the next occasion where it becomes
unsuited and runs contrary to his intentions.
Falling into the automatism of habit he fails
to adapt himself to the demands of the situation.
Thus in the first story the assistant forgot
that he was taken along in order to influence
the suitor in favor of the proposed bride, and
as he had thus far accomplished his task by
emphasizing through repetition the excellencies
attributed to the lady, he now emphasizes also
her timidly conceded hunch back which he
should have belittled.</p>

<p class='c008'>The marriage agent in the second story is so
fascinated by the failings and infirmities of the
bride that he completes the list from his own
knowledge, which it was certainly neither his
business nor his intention to do. Finally in
the third story he is so carried away by his
zeal to convince the young man of the family’s
wealth that in order to corroborate his proofs
he blurts out something which must upset all
his efforts. Everywhere the automatism triumphs
over the appropriate variation of
thought and expression.</p>

<p class='c008'>That is quite easy to understand, although
it must cause confusion when it is brought to
our attention that these three stories could just
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>as well be termed “comical” as “witty.” Like
every act of unmasking and self-betrayal the
discovery of the psychic automatism also belongs
to technique of the comic. We suddenly
see ourselves here confronted with the problem
of the relationship of wit to the comic element—a
subject which we endeavored to avoid (see
the Introduction). Are these stories only
“comical” and not “witty” also? Does the
comic element employ here the same means as
does the wit? And again, of what does the
peculiar character of wit consist?</p>

<p class='c008'>We must adhere to the fact that the technique
of the group of witticisms examined last
consists of nothing else but the establishment of
“faulty thinking.” We are forced to admit,
however, that so far the investigation has led
us further into darkness than to illumination.
Nevertheless we do not abandon the hope of
arriving at a result by means of a more thorough
knowledge of the technique of wit which
may become the starting-point for further insight.</p>

<h4 class='c016'><em>Unification</em></h4>

<p class='c017'>The next examples of wit with which we wish
to continue our investigation do not give us as
much work. Their technique reminds us very
much of what we already know. Here is one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>of Lichtenberg’s jokes. “<em>January</em>,” he says,
“<em>is the month in which one extends good wishes
to his friends, and the rest are months in which
the good wishes are not fulfilled.</em>”</p>

<p class='c008'>As these witticisms may be called clever
rather than strong, we shall reinforce the impression
by examining a few more.</p>

<p class='c008'>“<em>Human life is divided into two halves; during
the first one looks forward to the second,
and during the second one looks backward to
the first.</em>”</p>

<p class='c008'>“<em>Experience consists in experiencing what
one does not care to experience.</em>” (The last
two examples were cited by K. Fischer.)</p>

<p class='c008'>One cannot help being reminded by these examples
of a group, treated of before, which is
characterized by the “manifold application of
the same material.” The last example especially
will cause us to ask why we have not
inserted it there instead of presenting it here
in a new connection. “Experience” is described
through its own terms just as some of
the examples cited above. Neither would I be
against this correction. However, I am of the
opinion that the other two cases, which are
surely similar in character, contain a different
factor which is more striking and more important
than the manifold application of the
same word which shows nothing here touching
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>upon double meaning. And what is more, I
wish to emphasize that new and unexpected
identities are here formed which show themselves
in relations of ideas to one another, in
relations of definitions to each other, or to a
common third. I would call this process <em>unification</em>.
Obviously it is analogous to condensation
by compression into similar words. Thus the
two halves of human life are described by the
inter-relationship discovered between them:
during the first part one longs for the second,
and in the second one longs for the first. To
speak more precisely there were two relationships
very similar to each other which were
selected for description. The similarity of the
relationship that corresponds to the similarity of
the words which, just for this reason, might
recall the manifold application of the same
material—<span class='fraction'>(looks forward)<br>(looks backward).</span></p>

<p class='c008'>In Lichtenberg’s joke, January and the
months contrasted with it are characterized
again by a modified relationship to a third
factor: these are good wishes which one receives
in the first month, but are not fulfilled
during the other months. The differentiation
from the manifold application of the same material
which is really related to double meaning
is here quite clear.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>A good example of unification-wit needing
no explanation is the following:</p>

<p class='c008'><em>J. B. Rousseau, the French poet, wrote an
ode to posterity (à la postérité). Voltaire,
thinking that the poor quality of the poem in
no way justified its reaching posterity, wittily
remarked, “This poem will not reach its destination”</em>
(K. Fischer).</p>

<p class='c008'>The last example may remind us of the fact
that it is essentially unification which forms
the basis of the so-called repartee in wit. For
ready repartee consists in using the defense for
aggression and in “turning the tables” or in
“paying with the same coin.” That is, the
repartee consists in establishing an unexpected
identity between attack and counter-attack.</p>

<p class='c008'>For example, <em>a baker said to a tavern keeper,
one of whose fingers was festering: “I guess
your finger got into your beer.” The tavern
keeper replied: “You are wrong. One of your
rolls got under my finger nail”</em> (Ueberhorst:
<cite><span lang="de">Das Komische</span></cite>, II, 1900).</p>

<p class='c008'>While Serenissimus was traveling through his
domains he noticed a man in the crowds who
bore a striking resemblance to himself. He
beckoned him to come over and asked: “<em>Was
your mother ever employed in my home?</em>”
“<em>No, sire</em>,” replied the man, “<em>but my father
was.</em>”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>While Duke Karl of Würtemberg was riding
horseback he met a dyer working at his trade.
“<em>Can you color my white horse blue?</em>” “<em>Yes,
sire</em>,” was the rejoinder, “<em>if the animal can
stand the boiling!</em>”</p>

<p class='c008'>In this excellent repartee, which answers a
foolish question with a condition that is equally
impossible, there occurs another technical
factor which would have been omitted if the
dyer’s reply had been: “No, sire, I am afraid
that the horse could not stand being boiled.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Another peculiarly interesting technical
means at the disposal of unification is the addition
of the conjunction “and.” Such correlation
signifies a connection which could not be
understood otherwise. When Heine (<i><span lang="de">Harzreise</span></i>)
says of the city of Göttingen, “<em>In general the
inhabitants of Göttingen are divided into students,
professors, Philistines, and cattle</em>,” we
understand this combination exactly in the sense
which he furthermore emphasized by adding:
“These four social groups are distinguished little
less than sharply.” Again, when he speaks
about the school where he had to submit “<em>to
so much Latin, drubbing, and geography</em>,” he
wants to convey by this combination, which is
made very conspicuous by placing the drubbing
between the two studies, that the schoolboy’s
conception unmistakably described by the drubbing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>should be extended also to Latin and
geography.</p>

<p class='c008'>In Lipps’s book we find among the examples
of “witty enumeration” (Koordination) the
following verse, which stands nearest to Heine’s
“students, professors, Philistines, and cattle.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“<em>With a fork and with much effort his
mother pulled him from a mess.</em>”</p>

<p class='c008'>“As if effort were an instrument like the
fork,” adds Lipps by way of explanation. But
we get the impression that there is nothing
witty in this sentence. To be sure it is very
comical, whereas Heine’s co-ordination is undoubtedly
witty. We shall, perhaps, recall these
examples later when we shall no longer be
forced to evade the problem of the relationship
between wit and the comic.</p>

<h4 class='c016'><em>Representation Through the Opposite</em></h4>

<p class='c017'>We have remarked in the example of the
Duke and the dyer that it would still have been
a joke by means of unification had the dyer
replied, “No, I fear that the horse could not
stand being boiled.” In substituting a “yes”
for the “no” which rightly belonged there, we
meet a new technical means of wit the application
of which we shall study in other examples.</p>

<p class='c008'>This joke, which resembles the one we have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>just cited from K. Fischer, is somewhat simpler.
“<em>Frederick the Great heard of a Silesian
clergyman who had the reputation of communicating
with spirits. He sent for him and received
him with the following question: ‘Can
you call up ghosts?’ ‘At your pleasure, your
majesty,’ replied the clergyman, ‘but they
won’t come.’</em>” Here it is perfectly obvious
that the wit lies in the substitution of its opposite
for the only possible answer, “No.” To
complete this substitution “but” had to be
added to “yes,” so that “yes” plus “but”
gives the equivalent for “no.”</p>

<p class='c008'>This “representation through the opposite,” as
we choose to call it, serves the mechanism of
wit in several ways. In the following cases it
appears almost in its pure form:</p>

<p class='c008'>“<em>This woman resembles Venus de Milo in
many points. Like her she is extraordinarily
old, has no teeth, and has white spots on the
yellow surface of her body</em>” (Heine).</p>

<p class='c008'>Here ugliness is depicted by making it agree
with the most beautiful. Of course these agreements
consist of attributes expressed in double
meaning or of matters of slight importance.
The latter applies to the second example.</p>

<p class='c008'>“<em>The attributes of the greatest men were all
united in himself. Like Alexander his head
was tilted to one side: like Cæsar he always had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>something in his hair. He could drink coffee
like Leibnitz, and once settled in his armchair
he forgot eating and drinking like Newton, and
like him had to be awakened. He wore a wig
like Dr. Johnson, and like Cervantes the fly of
his trousers was always open</em>” (Lichtenberg:
<cite>The Great Mind</cite>).</p>

<p class='c008'>J. V. Falke’s <cite><span lang="de">Lebenserinnerungen an eine
Reise nach Ireland</span></cite> (page 271) furnishes an exceptionally
good example of “representation
through the opposite” in which the use of
words of a double meaning plays absolutely no
part. The scene is laid in a wax figure museum,
like Mme. Tussaud’s. A lecturer discourses on
one figure after another to his audience, which
is composed of old and young people. “<em>This is
the Duke of Wellington and his horse</em>,” he says.
Whereupon a young girl remarks, “<em>Which is
the duke and which is the horse?</em>” “<em>Just as
you like, my pretty child</em>,” is the reply. “<em>You
pay your money and you take your choice.</em>”</p>

<p class='c008'>The reduction of this Irish joke would be:
“It is gross impudence on the part of the
museum’s management to offer such an exhibition
to the public. It is impossible to distinguish
between the horse and the rider (playful
exaggeration), and it is for this exhibit that
one pays one’s hard-earned money!” The indignant
expression is now dramatized and applied
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>to a trivial occurrence. In the place of
the entire audience there appears one woman
and the riding figure becomes individually determined.
It is necessarily the Duke of Wellington,
who is so very popular in Ireland. But
the insolence of the museum proprietor or lecturer
who takes money from the public and
offers nothing in return is represented by the
opposite, through a speech, in which he extols
himself as a conscientious business man whose
fondest desire is to respect the rights to which
the public is entitled through the admission
fee. One then realizes that the technique of this
joke is not very simple. In so far as a way
is found to allow the swindler to assert his
scrupulosity it may be said that the joke is a
case of “representation through the opposite.”
The fact, however, that he does it on an occasion
where something different is demanded of
him, and the fact that he replies in terms of
commercial integrity when he is expected to discuss
the similarity of the figures, shows that it
is a case of displacement. The technique of
the joke lies in the combination of both technical
means.</p>

<h4 class='c016'><em>Outdoing wit</em></h4>

<p class='c017'>This example is closely allied to another
small group which might be called “outdoing-wit.”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>Here “yes,” which would be proper in
the reduction, is replaced by “no,” which, owing
to its context, is equivalent to a still stronger
“yes.” The same mechanism holds true when
the case is reversed. The contradiction takes
the place of an exaggerated confirmation. An
example of this nature is seen in the following
epigram from Lessing.<a id='r35'></a><a href='#f35' class='c007'><sup>[35]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>“<em>The good Galathee! ’Tis said that she dyes
her hair black, yet it was black when she bought
it.</em>”</p>

<p class='c008'>Lichtenberg’s make-believe mocking defense
of philosophy is another example.</p>

<p class='c008'>“<em>There are more things in heaven and earth
than are dreamt of in your philosophy</em>,” Prince
Hamlet had disdainfully declared. Lichtenberg
well knew that this condemnation was
by no means severe enough, in that it does not
take into account all that can be said against
philosophy. He therefore added the following:
“<em>But there is also much in philosophy which is
found neither in heaven nor on earth.</em>” To be
sure, his assertion supplements what was lacking
in Hamlet’s philosophical utterance, but in
doing this he adds another and still greater reproach.</p>

<p class='c008'>More transparent still, because they show
no trace of displacement, are two Jewish
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>jokes which are, however, of the coarse
kind.</p>

<p class='c008'><em>Two Jews were conversing about bathing.</em>
“<em>I take a bath once a year</em>,” said one, “<em>whether
I need one or not</em>.”</p>

<p class='c008'>It is clear that this boastful assurance of his
cleanliness only betrays his state of uncleanliness.</p>

<p class='c008'><em>A Jew noticed remnants of food on the beard
of another. “I can tell you what you ate yesterday,”
he remarked. “Well, let’s hear it,”
said another. “Beans,” said the first one. “You
are wrong,” responded the other. “I had beans
the day before yesterday.”</em></p>

<p class='c008'>The following example is an excellent “outdoing”
witticism which can be traced easily
to representation through the opposite.</p>

<p class='c008'><em>The king condescended to pay a visit at a
surgical clinic, and found the professor of surgery
engaged in amputating a leg. He watched
the various steps of the operation with interest
and expressed his royal approval with these
loud utterances: “Bravo, bravo, Professor.”
When the operation was over the professor
approached the king, bowed low, and asked:
“Does your majesty also command the amputation
of the other leg?”</em></p>

<p class='c008'>Whatever the professor may have thought
during this royal applause surely could not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>have been expressed unchanged. His real
thoughts were: “Judging by this applause he
must be under the impression that I am amputating
the poor devil’s diseased leg by order
of and for the pleasure of the king. To be
sure, I have other reasons for performing this
operation.” But instead of expressing these
thoughts he goes to the king and says: “I have
no other reasons but your majesty’s order for
performing this operation. The applause you
accorded me has inspired me so much that I
am only awaiting your majesty’s command to
amputate the other leg also.” He thus succeeded
in making himself understood by expressing
the opposite of what he really thought
but had to keep to himself. Such an expression
of the opposite represents an incredible
exaggeration or outdoing.</p>

<p class='c008'>As we gather from these examples, representation
through the opposite is a means frequently
and effectively used in the technique
of wit. We need not overlook, however, something
else, namely, that this technique is by
no means confined only to wit. When Marc
Antony, after his long speech in the Forum
had changed the mood of the mob listening
to Cæsar’s obsequies, at last repeats the
words,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c018'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“For Brutus was an honorable man,”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c019'><span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>he well knows that the mob will scream the
true meaning of his words at him, namely,</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>“They are traitors: nice honorable men!”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Or when <i><span lang="la">Simplicissimus</span></i> transcribes a collection
of unheard-of brutalities and cynicisms
as expressions of “people with temperaments,”
this, too, is a representation through the opposite.
However, this is no longer designated as
wit, but as “irony.” Indeed, the only technique
that is characteristic of irony is representation
through the opposite. Besides, one reads and
hears about “ironical wit.” Hence there is no
longer any doubt that technique alone is not
capable of characterizing wit. There must be
something else which we have not yet discovered.
On the other hand, however, the fact
that the reduction of the technique destroys the
wit still remains uncontradicted. For the present
it may be difficult for us to unite for the
explanation of wit the two strong points which
we have already gained.</p>

<h4 class='c016'><em>Indirect Expression</em></h4>

<p class='c017'>Since representation through the opposite
belongs to the technical means of wit, we may
also expect that wit could make use of its reverse,
namely, the representation through the
similar and cognate. Indeed, when we continue
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>our investigation we find that this forms the
technique of a new and especially extensive
group of thought-witticisms. We can describe
the peculiarity of this technique much better
if instead of representation through the “cognate”
we use the expression representation
through “relationships and associations.” We
shall start with the last characteristic and illustrate
it by an example.</p>

<h4 class='c016'><em>Indirect Expression with Allusion</em></h4>

<p class='c017'>It is an American anecdote and runs as
follows. <em>By undertaking a series of risky
schemes, two not very scrupulous business men
had succeeded in amassing an enormous fortune
and were now intent on forcing their way
into good society. Among other things they
thought it advisable to have their portraits
painted by the most prominent and most expensive
painters in the city, men whose works
were considered masterpieces. The costly pictures
were exhibited for the first time at a great
evening gathering, and the hosts themselves led
the most prominent connoisseur and art critic
to the wall of the salon on which both portraits
were hanging side by side, in order to elicit
from him a favorable criticism. He examined
the portraits for a long time, then shook his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>head as if he were missing something. At
length he pointed to the bare space between
the pictures, and asked, “And where is the
Savior?”</em></p>

<p class='c008'>The meaning of this expression is clear. It
is again the expression of something which cannot
be represented directly. In what way does
this “indirect expression” come about? By a
series of very obvious associations and conclusions
let us work backwards from the verbal
setting.</p>

<p class='c008'>The query, “<em>where is the Savior?</em>” or “<em>where
is the picture of the Savior?</em>” arouses the conjecture
that the two pictures have reminded the
speaker of a similar arrangement familiar to
him as it is familiar to us. This arrangement,
of which one element is here missing, shows the
figure of the Savior between two other figures.
There is only one such case: Christ hanging
between the two thieves. The missing element
is emphasized by the witticism, and the similarity
rests in the figures at the right and left of
the Savior, which are not mentioned in the jest.
It can only mean that the pictures hanging in
the drawing-room are likewise those of thieves.
This is what the critic wished to, but could
not say, “You are a pair of scoundrels,” or
more in detail, “What do I care about your
portraits? You are a pair of scoundrels, that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>I know.” And by means of a few associations
and conclusive inferences he has said it in a
manner which we designate as “allusion.”</p>

<p class='c008'>We immediately remember that we have
encountered the process of allusion before.
Namely, in double meaning, when one of the
two meanings expressed by the same word
stands out very prominently, because being used
much oftener and more commonly, our attention
is directed to it first, whereas the other
meaning remains in the background because it
is more remote—such cases we wished to describe
as double meaning with allusion. In an
entire series of examples which we have hitherto
examined, we have remarked that their technique
is not simple and we realized that the
process of allusion was the factor that complicated
it. For example, see the contradiction-witticism
in which the congratulations on the
birth of the youngest child are acknowledged by
the remark that it is remarkable what human
hands can accomplish (p. 77).</p>

<p class='c008'>In the American anecdote we have the process
of allusion without the double meaning, and we
find that the character of this process consists
in completing the picture through mental association.
It is not difficult to guess that the
utilized association can be of more than one
kind. So as not to be confused by large numbers
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>we shall discuss only the most pronounced
variations, and shall give only a few examples.</p>

<p class='c008'>The association used in the substitution may
be a mere sound, so that this sub-group may
be analogous to word-wit in the pun. However,
it is not similarity in sound of two words,
but of whole sentences, characteristic combinations
of words, and similar means.</p>

<p class='c008'>For example, Lichtenberg coined the saying:
“<em>New baths heal well</em>,” which immediately reminds
one of the proverb, “<em>New brooms clean
well</em>,” whose first and last words, as well as
whose whole sentence structure, is the same as
in the first saying. It has undoubtedly arisen
in the witty thinker’s mind as an imitation of
the familiar proverb. Thus Lichtenberg’s saying
is an allusion to the latter. By means of
this allusion something is suggested that cannot
be frankly said, namely, that the efficacy
of the baths taken as cures is due to other
things beside the thermal springs whose attributes
are the same everywhere.</p>

<p class='c008'>The solution of the technique of another one
of Lichtenberg’s jokes is similar: “<em>The girl
barely twelve modes old.</em>” That sounds something
like the chronological term “<em>twelve
moons</em>” (i.e., months), and may originally have
been a mistake in writing in the permissible
poetical expression. But there is a good deal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>of sense in designating the age of a feminine
creature by the changing modes instead of by
the changing of moons.</p>

<p class='c008'>The connection of similarity may even consist
of a single slight modification. This technique
again runs parallel with a word-technique.
Both kinds of witticisms create almost the
identical impression, but they are more easily
distinguishable by the processes of the wit-work.</p>

<p class='c008'>The following is an example of such a word-witticism
or pun. The great singer, Mary
Wilt, who was famous not merely on account
of the magnitude of her voice, suffered the
mortification of having a title of a play, dramatized
from the well-known novel of Jules
Verne, serve as an allusion to her corpulency.
“<em>The trip around the Wilt</em> (world) <em>in eighty
days</em>.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Or: “<em>Every fathom a queen</em>,” which is a
modification of the familiar Shakespearian
quotation, “<em>Every inch a king</em>,” and served as
an allusion to a prominent woman who was unusually
big physically. There would really be
no serious objection if one should prefer to
classify this witticism as a substitution for condensation
with modification (cf. tête-à-bête,
p. 25).</p>

<p class='c008'>Discussing the hardships of the medical profession,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>namely, that physicians are obliged to
read and study constantly because remedies and
drugs once considered efficacious are later rejected
as useless, and that despite the physician’s
best efforts the patient often refuses to
pay for the treatment, one of the doctors present
remarked: “<em>Yes, every drug has its day</em>,” to
which another added, “<em>But not every Doc gets
his pay</em>.” These two witty remarks are both
modifications with allusion of the well-known
saying, “<em>Every dog has his day</em>.” But here,
too, the technique could be described as fusion
with modification.</p>

<p class='c008'>If the modification contents itself with a
change in letters, allusions through modifications
are barely distinguishable from condensation
with substitutive formation, as shown in
this example: “<em>Mellingitis</em>,” <em>the allusion to the
dangerous disease meningitis, refers to the
danger which the conservative members of a
provincial borough in England thought impended
if the socialist candidate Mellon were
elected</em>.</p>

<p class='c008'>The negative particles make very good allusions
at the cost of very little changing. Heine
referred to Spinoza as:</p>

<p class='c008'>“My fellow <em>un</em>believer Spinoza.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“We, by the <em>Un</em>grace of God, Laborers,
Bondsmen, Negroes, Serfs,” etc., is a manifesto
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>(which Lichtenberg quotes no further) of these
unfortunates who probably have more right to
that title than kings and dukes have to the unmodified
one.</p>

<h4 class='c016'><em>Omission</em></h4>

<p class='c017'>Finally <em>omission</em>, which is comparable to condensation
without substitutive formation, is also
a form of allusion. For in every allusion there
is really something omitted, namely, the trend
of thought that leads to the allusion. It is
only a question of whether the gap, or the substitute
in the wording of the allusion which
partly fills in the gap, is the more obvious
element. Thus we come back through a series
of examples from the very clear cases of omission
to those of actual allusion.</p>

<p class='c008'>Omission without substitution is found in
the following example. There lived in Vienna
a clever and bellicose writer whose sharp invectives
had repeatedly brought him bodily
assault at the hands of the persons he assailed.
During a conversation about a new misdeed by
one of his habitual opponents, some one said,
“<em>When X. hears this he will receive another
box on his ear</em>.” The technique of this wit
shows in the first place the confusion about
the apparent contradiction, for it is by no means
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>clear to us why a box on one’s ear should be
the direct result of having heard something.
The contradiction disappears if one fills in the
gap by adding to the remark: “<em>then he will
write such a caustic article against that person
that, etc.</em>” Allusions through omission and contradiction
are thus the technical means of this
witticism.</p>

<p class='c008'>Heine remarked about some one: “<em>He praises
himself so much that pastils for fumigation are
advancing in price.</em>” This omission can easily
be filled in. What has been omitted is replaced
by an inference which then strikes back as an
allusion to the same. For self-praise has always
carried an evil odor with it.</p>

<p class='c008'>Once more we encounter the two Jews in
front of the bathing establishment. “<em>Another
year has passed by already</em>,” says one with a
sigh.</p>

<p class='c008'>These examples leave no doubt that the omission
is meant as an allusion.</p>

<p class='c008'>A still more obvious omission is contained
in the next example, which is really a genuine
and correct allusion-witticism. Subsequent to
an artists’ banquet in Vienna a joke book was
given out in which, among others, the following
most remarkable proverb could be read:</p>

<p class='c008'>“<em>A wife is like an umbrella, at worst one may
also take a cab.</em>”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>An umbrella does not afford enough protection
from rain. The words “<em>at worst</em>” can
mean only: when it is raining hard. A cab
is a public conveyance. As we have to deal
here with the figure of comparison, we shall put
off the detailed investigation of this witticism
until later on.</p>

<p class='c008'>Heine’s “Bäder von Lucca” contains a veritable
wasps’ nest of stinging allusions which
make the most artistic use of this form of wit as
polemics against the Count of Platen. Long
before the reader can suspect their application,
a certain theme, which does not lend itself especially
to direct presentation, is preluded by
allusions of the most varied material possible;
e.g., in Hirsch-Hyacinth’s twisting of words:
You are too corpulent and I am too lean; you
possess too much conceit and I the more business
ability; I am a practicus and you are a
diarrheticus, in fine, “You are altogether my
Antipodex”—“Venus Urinia”—the thick Gudel
of Dreckwall in Hamburg, etc. Then the
occurrences of which the poet speaks take a
turn in which it merely seems to show the impolite
sportiveness of the poet, but soon it discloses
the symbolic relation to the polemical intention,
and in this way it also reveals itself as
allusion. At last the attack against Platen
bursts forth, and now the allusions to the subject
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>of the Count’s love for men seethe and
gush from each one of the sentences which
Heine directs against the talent and the character
of his opponent, e.g.:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Even if the Muses are not well disposed
to him, he has at least the genius of speech in
his power, or rather he knows how to violate
him; for he lacks the free love of this genius,
besides he must perseveringly run after this
youth, and he knows only how to grasp the
outer forms which, in spite of their beautiful
rotundity, never express anything noble.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“He has the same experience as the ostrich,
which considers itself sufficiently hidden when
it sticks its head into the sand so that only its
backside is visible. Our illustrious bird would
have done better if he had stuck his backside
into the sand, and had shown us his head.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Allusion is perhaps the commonest and most
easily employed means of wit, and is at the basis
of most of the short-lived witty productions
which we are wont to weave into our conversation.
They cannot bear being separated from
their native soil nor can they exist independently.
Once more we are reminded by the
process of allusion of that relationship which
has already begun to confuse our estimation of
the technique of wit. The process of allusion
is not witty in itself; there are perfectly formed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>allusions which have no claims to this character.
Only those allusions which show a “witty”
element are witty, hence the characteristics of
wit, which we have followed even into its technique,
again escape us.</p>

<p class='c008'>I have sometimes called allusion “indirect expression,”
and now recognize that the different
kinds of allusion with representation through
the opposite, as well as the techniques still to be
mentioned, can be united into a single large
group for which “indirect expression” would
be the comprehensive name. Hence, <em>errors of
thought—unification—indirect representation</em>—are
those points of view under which we can
group the techniques of thought-wit which became
known to us.</p>

<h4 class='c016'><em>Representation Through the Minute or the Minutest Element</em></h4>

<p class='c017'>On continuing the investigation of our material
we think we recognize a new sub-group
of indirect representation which though sharply
defined can be illustrated only by few examples.
It is that of representation through a minute
or minutest element; solving the problem by
bringing the entire character to full expression
through a minute detail. Correlating this
group with the mechanism of allusion is made
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>possible by looking at the triviality as connected
with the thing to be presented and as a
result of it. For example:</p>

<p class='c008'><em>A Jew who was riding in a train had made
himself very comfortable; he had unbuttoned
his coat, and had put his feet on the seat, when
a fashionably dressed gentleman came in. The
Jew immediately put on his best behavior and
assumed a modest position. The stranger
turned over the pages of a book, did some calculation,
and pondered a moment and suddenly
addressed the Jew. “I beg your pardon, how
soon will we have Yom Kippur?” (Day of
Atonement). “Oh, oh!” said the Jew, and
put his feet back on the seat before he answered.</em></p>

<p class='c008'>It cannot be denied that this representation
through something minute is allied to the tendency
of economy which we found to be the final
common element in the investigation of the
technique of word-wit.</p>

<p class='c008'>The following example is much similar.</p>

<p class='c008'><em>The doctor who had been summoned to help
the baroness in her confinement declared that
the critical moment had not arrived, and proposed
to the baron that they play a game of
cards in the adjoining room in the meantime.
After a while the doleful cry of the baroness
reached the ears of the men. “Ah, mon Dieu,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>que je souffre!” The husband jumped up, but
the physician stopped him saying, “That’s
nothing; let us play on.” A little while later
the woman in labor-pains was heard again:
“My God, my God, what pains!” “Don’t
you want to go in, Doctor?” asked the baron.
“By no means, it is not yet time,” answered the
doctor. At last there rang from the adjacent
room the unmistakable cry, “A-a-a-ai-e-e-e-e-e-e-E-E-E!”
The physician then threw down the
cards and said, “Now it’s time.”</em></p>

<p class='c008'>How the pain allows the original nature to
break through all the strata of education, and
how an important decision is rightly made dependent
upon a seemingly inconsequential utterance—both
are shown in this good joke by the
successive changes in the cries of this childbearing
lady of quality.</p>

<h4 class='c016'><em>Comparison</em></h4>

<p class='c017'>Another kind of indirect expression of which
wit makes use is <em>comparison</em>, which we have not
discussed so far because an examination of comparison
touches upon new difficulties, or rather
it reveals difficulties which have made their
appearance on other occasions. We have already
admitted that in many of the examples
examined we could not banish all doubts as to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>whether they should really be counted as witty,
and have recognized in this uncertainty a serious
shock to the principles of our investigation.
But in no other material do I feel this uncertainty
greater and nowhere does it occur more
frequently than in the case of comparison-wit.
The feeling which usually says to me—and I
dare say to a great many others under the same
conditions—this is a joke, this may be written
down as witty before even the hidden and
essential character of the wit has been uncovered—this
feeling I lack most. If at first I
experience no hesitation in declaring the comparison
to be a witticism, then the next instant
I seem to think that the pleasure I thus found
was of a different quality than that which I am
accustomed to ascribe to a joke. Also the fact
that witty comparisons but seldom can evoke
the explosive variety of laughter by which a
good joke proves itself makes it impossible for
me to cast aside the existing doubts, even when
I limit myself to the best and most effective
examples.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is easy to demonstrate that there are some
especially good and effective examples of comparison
which in no way give us the impression
of witticisms. A beautiful example of this
kind which I have not yet tired of admiring,
and the impression of which still clings to me,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>I shall not deny myself the pleasure of citing.
It is a comparison with which Ferd. Lassalle
concluded one of his famous pleas (<i><span lang="de">Die Wissenschaft
und die Arbeiter</span></i>): “A man like myself
who, as I explained to you, had devoted his
whole life to the motto ‘<span lang="de">Die Wissenschaft und
die Arbeiter</span>’ (Science and the Workingman),
would receive the same impression from a condemnation
which in the course of events confronts
him <em>as would the chemist, absorbed in
his scientific experiments, from the cracking of
a retort. With a slight knitting of his brow at
the resistance of the material, he would, as soon
as the disturbance was quieted, calmly continue
his labor and investigations.</em>”</p>

<p class='c008'>One finds a rich assortment of pertinent and
witty comparisons in the writings of Lichtenberg
(2 B. of the Göttingen edition, 1853).
I shall take the material for our investigation
from that source.</p>

<p class='c008'>“<em>It is almost impossible to carry the torch
of truth through a crowd without singeing
somebody’s beard.</em>” This may seem witty, but
on closer examination one notices that the witty
effect does not come from the comparison itself
but from a secondary attribute of the same.
For the expression “the torch of truth” is no
new comparison, but one which has been used
for a long time and which has degenerated into
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>a fixed phrase, as always happens when a comparison
has the luck to be absorbed into the
common usage of speech. But whereas we
hardly notice the comparison in the saying,
“the torch of truth,” its original full force is
restored it by Lichtenberg, since by building
further on the comparison it results in a deduction.
But the taking of blurred expressions
in their full sense is already known to us as a
technique of wit; it finds a place with the Manifold
Application of the Same Material (p. 35).
It may well be that the witty impression created
by Lichtenberg’s sentence is due only to its relation
to this technique of wit.</p>

<p class='c008'>The same explanation will undoubtedly hold
good for another witty comparison by the same
author.</p>

<p class='c008'>“<em>The man was not exactly a shining light,
but a great candlestick.... He was a professor
of philosophy.</em>”</p>

<p class='c008'>To call a scholar a shining light, a “<i><span lang="la">lumen
mundi</span></i>,” has long ceased to be an effective comparison,
whether it be originally qualified as a
witticism or not. But here the comparison was
freshened up and its full force was restored to
it by deducting a modification from it and in
this way setting up a second and new comparison.
The way in which the second comparison
came into existence seems to contain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>the condition of the witticism and not the two
comparisons themselves. This would then be
a case of Identical Wit-Technique as in the
example of the torch.</p>

<p class='c008'>The following comparison seems witty on
other but similarly classifiable grounds: “<em>I
look upon reviews as a kind of children’s disease</em>
which more or less attacks new-born books.
There are cases on record where the healthiest
died of it, and the puniest have often lived
through it. Many do not get it at all. Attempts
have frequently been made to prevent
the disease by means of <em>amulets of prefaces and
dedications, or to color them up by personal
pronunciamentos; but it does not always help</em>.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The comparison of reviews with children’s
diseases is based in the first place upon their
susceptibility to attack shortly after they have
seen the light of the world. Whether this
makes it witty I do not trust myself to decide.
But when the comparison is continued, it is
found that the later fates of the new books may
be represented within the scope of the same or
by means of similar comparisons. Such a continuation
of a comparison is undoubtedly witty,
but we know already to what technique it owes
its witty flavor; it is a case of <em>unification</em> or the
establishment of an unexpected association.
The character of the unification, however, is not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>changed by the fact that it consists here of a
relationship with the first comparison.</p>

<h4 class='c016'><em>Doubt in Witty Comparisons</em></h4>

<p class='c017'>In a series of other comparisons one is
tempted to ascribe an indisputably existing
witty impression to another factor which again
in itself has nothing to do with the nature of
the comparison. These are comparisons which
are strikingly grouped, often containing a combination
that sounds absurd, which comes into
existence as a result of the comparison. Most
of Lichtenberg’s examples belong to this group.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It is a pity that one cannot see the <em>learned
bowels</em> of the writers, in order to find out what
they have eaten.” “<em>The learned bowels</em>” is a
confusing, really absurd attribute which is
made clear only by the comparison. How
would it be if the witty impression of this comparison
should be referred entirely and fully to
the confusing character of their composition?
This would correspond to one of the means of
wit well known to us, namely, representation
through absurdity.</p>

<p class='c008'>Lichtenberg has used the same comparison of
the imbibing of reading and educational material
with the imbibing of physical nourishment.</p>

<p class='c008'>“He thought highly of <em>studying in his room</em>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>and was heartily in favor of <em>learned stable
fodder</em>.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The same absurd or at least conspicuous attributes,
which as we are beginning to notice are
the real carriers of the wit, mark other comparisons
of the same author.</p>

<p class='c008'>“<em>This is the weatherside of my moral constitution,
here I can stand almost anything.</em>”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Every person has also his <em>moral backside</em>
which he does not show <em>except under the stress
of necessity</em> and which he covers as long as
possible with the <em>pants of good-breeding</em>.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The “moral backside” is the peculiar attribute
which exists as the result of a comparison.
But this is followed by a continuation of the
comparison with a regular play on words
(“necessity”) and a second, still more unusual
combination (“the pants of good-breeding”),
which is possibly witty in itself; for the pants
become witty, as it were, because they are the
pants of good-breeding. Therefore it may not
take us by surprise if we get the impression of
a very witty comparison; we are beginning to
notice that we show a general tendency in our
estimation to extend a quality to the whole
thing when it clings only to one part of it.
Besides, the “pants of good-breeding” remind
us of a similar confusing verse of Heine.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>“<em>Until, at last, the buttons tore from the
pants of my patience.</em>”</p>

<p class='c008'>It is obvious that both of the last comparisons
possess a character which one cannot find in all
good, i.e., fitting, comparisons. One might say
that they are in a large manner “debasing,” for
they place a thing of high category, an abstraction
(good-breeding, patience), side by side with
a thing of a very concrete nature of a very low
kind (pants). Whether this peculiarity has
something to do with wit we shall have to
consider in another connection. Let us attempt
to analyze another example in which the degrading
character is exceptionally well defined.
In Nestroy’s farce “<cite><span lang="de">Einen Jux will er sich
machen</span></cite>,” the clerk, Weinberl, who resolves in
his imagination how he will ponder over his
youth when he has some day become a well-established
old merchant, says: “<em>When in the
course of confidential conversation the ice is
chopped up before the warehouse of memory;
when the portal of the storehouse of antiquity
is unlocked again; and when the mattings of
phantasy are stocked full with wares of yore.</em>”
These are certainly comparisons of abstractions
with very common, concrete things, but the
witticism depends—exclusively or only partially—upon
the circumstance that a clerk
makes use of these comparisons which are taken
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>from the sphere of his daily occupation. But
to bring the abstract in relation to the commonplace
with which he is otherwise filled is an act
of <em>unification</em>. Let us revert to Lichtenberg’s
comparisons.</p>

<h4 class='c016'><em>Peculiar Attributions</em></h4>

<p class='c017'>“<em>The motives for our actions may be arranged
like the thirty-two winds, and their
names may be classified in a similar way, e.g.,
Bread-bread-glory or Glory-glory-bread.</em>”</p>

<p class='c008'>As so often happens in Lichtenberg’s witticisms,
in this case, too, the impression of appropriateness,
cleverness, and ingenuity is so
marked that our judgment of the character of
the witty element is thereby misled. If something
witty is intermingled in such an utterance
with the excellent sense, we probably are deluded
into declaring the whole to be an exceptional
joke. Moreover, I dare say that everything
that is really witty about it results from
the strangeness of the peculiar combination
bread-bread-glory. Thus as far as wit is concerned
it is representation through absurdity.</p>

<p class='c008'>The peculiar combination or absurd attribution
can alone be represented as a product of a
comparison.</p>

<p class='c008'>Lichtenberg says: “<em>A twice-sleepy woman—a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>once-sleepy church pew</em>.” Behind each one
there is a comparison with a bed; in both cases
there is besides the comparison also the technical
factor of <em>allusion</em>. Once it is an allusion
to the soporific effect of sermons, and the second
time to the inexhaustible theme of sex.</p>

<p class='c008'>Having found hitherto that a comparison as
often as it appears witty owes this impression
to its connection with one of the techniques of
wit known to us, there are nevertheless some
other examples which seem to point to the fact
that a comparison as such can also be witty.</p>

<p class='c008'>This is Lichtenberg’s characteristic remark
about certain odes. “They are in poetry what
Jacob Böhm’s immortal writings are in prose—<em>they
are a kind of picnic in which the author
supplies the words, and the readers the meaning</em>.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“When he <em>philosophizes</em>, he generally sheds
<em>an agreeable moonlight</em> over his topics, which is
in the main quite pleasant, but which does not
show any one subject clearly.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Again, Heine’s description: “<em>Her face resembled
a kodex palimpsestus, where under the new
block-lettered text of a church father peek forth
the half-obliterated verses of an ancient Hellenic
erotic poet.</em>”</p>

<p class='c008'>Or, the continued comparison of a very degrading
tendency, in the “Bäder von Lucca.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>“<em>The Catholic priest</em> is more like a clerk
who is employed in a big business; the church,
the big house at the head of which is the Pope,
gives him a definite salary. He works lazily
like one who is not working on his own account,
he has many colleagues, and so easily remains
unnoticed in the big business enterprise. He is
concerned only in the credit of the house and
still more in its preservation, since he would be
deprived of his means of sustenance in case
it went bankrupt. <em>The Protestant clergyman</em>,
on the other hand, is his own boss, and carries
on the religious businesses on his own account.
He has no wholesale trade like his Catholic
brother-tradesman, but deals merely at retail;
and since he himself must understand it, he
cannot be lazy. He must praise his <em>articles of
faith</em> to the people and must disparage the
articles of his competitors. Like a true small
trader he stands in his retail store, full of envy
of the industry of all large houses, particularly
the large house in Rome which has so many
thousand bookkeepers and packers on its payroll,
and which owns factories in all four corners
of the world.”</p>

<p class='c008'>In the face of this, as in many other examples,
we can no longer dispute the fact that a comparison
may in itself be witty, and that the
witty impression need not necessarily depend
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>on one of the known techniques of wit. But
we are entirely in the dark as to what determines
the witty character of the comparison,
since it certainly does not cling to the similarity
as a form of expression of the thought, or to
the operation of the comparison. We can do
nothing but include comparison with the different
forms of “indirect representation” which
are at the disposal of the technique of wit, and
the problem, which confronted us more distinctly
in the mechanism of comparison than
in the means of wit hitherto treated, must remain
unsolved. There must surely be a special
reason why the decision whether something is a
witticism or not presents more difficulties in
cases of comparison than in other forms of expression.</p>

<p class='c008'>This gap in our understanding, however, offers
no ground for complaint that our first investigation
has been unsuccessful. Considering
the intimate connection which we had to be prepared
to ascribe to the different types of wit,
it would have been imprudent to expect that
we could fully explain this aspect of the problem
before we had cast a glance over the others.
We shall have to take up this problem at
another place.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span><em>Review of the Techniques of Wit</em></p>

<p class='c008'>Are we sure that none of the possible techniques
of wit has escaped our investigation?
Not exactly; but by a continued examination
of new material, we can convince ourselves that
we have become acquainted with the most numerous
and most important technical means of
wit-work—at least with as much as is necessary
for formulating a judgment about the nature
of this psychic process. At present no such
judgment exists; on the other hand, we have
come into possession of important indications,
from the direction of which we may expect a
further explanation of the problem. The interesting
processes of condensation with substitutive
formation, which we have recognized as
the nucleus of the technique of word-wit, directed
our attention to the dream-formation in
whose mechanism the identical psychic processes
were discovered. Thither also we are directed
by the technique of the thought-wit, namely displacement,
faulty thinking, absurdity, indirect
expression, and representation through the opposite—each
and all are also found in the technique
of dreams. The dream is indebted to
displacement for its strange appearance, which
hinders us from recognizing in it the continuation
of our waking thoughts; the dream’s use
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>of absurdity and contradiction has cost it the
dignity of a psychic product, and has misled the
authors to assume that the determinants of
dream-formation are: collapse of mental activity,
cessation of criticism, morality, and logic.
Representation through the opposite is so common
in dreams that even the popular but entirely
misleading books on dream interpretation
usually put it to good account. Indirect
expression, the substitution for the dream-thought
by an allusion, by a trifle or by a
symbolism analogous to comparison, is just exactly
what distinguishes the manner of expression
of the dream from our waking thoughts.<a id='r36'></a><a href='#f36' class='c007'><sup>[36]</sup></a>
Such a far-reaching agreement as found between
the means of wit-work and those of
dream-work can scarcely be accidental. To
show those agreements in detail and to trace
their motivations will be one of our future tasks.</p>

</div>

<p class='c006'>Near the end of the preceding chapter as I
was writing down Heine’s comparison of the
Catholic priest to an employee of a large business
house, and the comparison of the Protestant
divine to an independent retail dealer,
I felt an inhibition which nearly prevented me
from using this comparison. I said to myself
that among my readers probably there would
be some who hold in veneration not only religion,
but also its administration and administrators.
These readers might take offense at
the comparison and get so wrought up about
it that it would take away all interest in the
investigation as to whether the comparison
seemed witty in itself or was witty only through
its garnishings. In other examples, e.g., the
one mentioned above concerning the agreeable
moonlight shed by a certain philosophy, there
would be no worry that for some readers it
might be a disturbing influence in our investigation.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>Even the most religious person would
remain in the right mood to form a judgment
about our problem.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is easy to guess the character of the witticism
by the kind of reaction that wit exerts
on the hearer. Sometimes wit is wit for its
own sake and serves no other particular purpose;
then again, it places itself at the service
of such a purpose, i.e., it becomes purposive.
Only that form of wit which has such a tendency
runs the risk of ruffling people who do
not wish to hear it.</p>

<p class='c008'>Theo. Vischer called wit without a tendency
“<em>abstract</em>” wit, I prefer to call it “<em>harmless</em>”
wit.</p>

<p class='c008'>As we have already classified wit according
to the material touched by its technique into
word- and thought-wit, it is incumbent upon us
to investigate the relation of this classification
to the one just put forward. Word- and
thought-wit on the one hand, and abstract- and
tendency-wit on the other hand, bear no relation
of dependence to each other; they are two entirely
independent classifications of witty productions.
Perhaps some one may have gotten
the impression that harmless witticisms are preponderately
word-witticisms, whereas the complicated
techniques of thought-witticisms are
mostly made to serve strong tendencies. There
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>are harmless witticisms that operate through
play on words and sound similarity, and just as
harmless ones which make use of all means of
thought-wit. Nor is it less easy to prove that
tendency-wit as far as technique is concerned
may be merely the wit of words. Thus, for example,
witticisms that “<em>play</em>” with proper
names often show an insulting and offending
tendency, and yet they, too, belong to word-wit.
Again, the most harmless of all jests are word-witticisms.
Examples of this nature are the
popular “shake-up” rhymes (Schüttelreime)
in which the technique is represented through
the manifold application of the same material
with a very peculiar modification:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Having been forsaken by <em>Dame Luck</em>, he
degenerated into a <em>Lame Duck</em>.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Let us hope that no one will deny that the
pleasure experienced in this kind of otherwise
unpretentious rhyming is of the same nature as
the one by which we recognize wit.</p>

<p class='c008'>Good examples of abstract or harmless
thought-witticisms abound in Lichtenberg’s comparisons
with which we have already become acquainted.
I add a few more. “<em>They sent a
small Octavo to the University of Göttingen;
and received back in body and soul a quarto</em>”
(a fourth-form boy).</p>

<p class='c008'>“<em>In order to erect this budding well, one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>must lay above all things a good foundation,
and I know of no firmer than by laying immediately
over every pro-layer a contra-layer.</em>”</p>

<p class='c008'>“<em>One man begets the thought, the second
acts as its godfather, the third begets children
by it, the fourth visits it on its death-bed, and
the fifth buries it</em>” (comparison with unification).</p>

<p class='c008'>“<em>Not only did he disbelieve in ghosts, but he
was not ever afraid of them.</em>” The witticism in
this case lies exclusively in the absurd representation
which puts what is usually considered
less important in the comparative and what is
considered more important in the positive degree.
If we divest it of its dress it says: it is
much easier to use our reason and make light
of the fear of ghosts than to defend ourselves
against this fear when the occasion presents itself.
But this rendering is no longer witty; it
is merely a correct and still too little respected
psychological fact suggesting what Lessing expresses
in his well-known words:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c018'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Not all are free who mock their chains.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<h4 class='c016'><em>Harmless and Tendency Wit</em></h4>

<p class='c017'>I shall take the opportunity presented here
of clearing up what may still lead to a possible
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>misunderstanding. “Harmless” or “abstract”
wit should in no way convey the same meaning
as “shallow” or “poor” wit. It is meant
only to designate the opposite of the “tendency”
wit to be described later. As shown
in the aforementioned examples, a harmless
jest, i.e., a witticism without a tendency, can
also be very rich in content and express something
worth while. The quality of a witticism,
however, is independent of the wit and represents
the quality of the thought which is here
expressed wittily by means of a special contrivance.
To be sure, just as watch-makers are
wont to enclose very good works in valuable
cases, so it may likewise happen with wit that
the best witty activities are used to invest the
richest thoughts.</p>

<p class='c008'>Now, if we pay strict attention to the distinction
between thought-content and the witty
wording of thought-wit, we arrive at an insight
which may clear up much uncertainty in our
judgment of wit. For it turns out—astonishing
as it may seem—that our enjoyment of a
witticism is supplied by the combined impression
of content and wit-activity, and that one
of the factors is likely to deceive us about the
extent of the other. It is only the reduction of
the witticism that lays bare to us our mistaken
judgment.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>The same thing applies to word-wit. When
we hear that “<em>experience consists simply of experiencing
what one wishes he had not experienced</em>,”
we are puzzled, and believe that we
have learnt a new truth; it takes some time before
we recognize in this disguise the platitude,
“adversity is the school of wisdom” (K.
Fischer). The excellent wit-activity which
seeks to define “experience” by the almost
exclusive use of the word “experience” deceives
us so completely that we overestimate
the content of the sentence. The same thing
happens in many similar cases and also in
Lichtenberg’s unification-witticism about January
(p. 89), which expresses nothing but what
we already know, namely, that New Year’s
wishes are as seldom realized as other wishes.</p>

<p class='c008'>We find the contrary true of other witticisms,
in which obviously what is striking and correct
in the thought captivates us, so that we call
the saying an excellent witticism, whereas it
is only the thought that is brilliant while the
wit-activity is often weak. It is especially true
of Lichtenberg’s wit that the path of the
thought is often of more value than its witty
expression, though we unjustly extend the
value of the former to the latter. Thus the
remark about the “torch of truth” (p. 115) is
hardly a witty comparison, but it is so striking
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>that we are inclined to lay stress on the sentence
as exceptionally witty.</p>

<p class='c008'>Lichtenberg’s witticisms are above all remarkable
for their thought-content and their
certainty of hitting the mark. Goethe has
rightly remarked about this author that his
witty and jocose thoughts positively conceal
problems. Or perhaps it may be more correct
to say that they touch upon the solutions of
problems. When, for example, he presents as
a witty thought:</p>

<p class='c008'>“He always read <em>Agamemnon</em> instead of the
German word <i><span lang="de">angenommen</span></i>, so thoroughly had
he read Homer” (technically this is absurdity
plus sound similarity of words). Thus he discovered
nothing less than the secret of mistakes
in reading.<a id='r38'></a><a href='#f38' class='c007'><sup>[38]</sup></a> The following joke, whose technique
(p. 78) seemed to us quite unsatisfactory,
is of a similar nature.</p>

<p class='c008'>“<em>He was surprised that there were two holes
cut in the pelts of cats just where the eyes were
located.</em>” The stupidity here exhibited is only
seemingly so; in reality this ingenuous remark
conceals the great problem of teleology in the
structure of animals; it is not at all so self-evident
that the eyelid cleft opens just where the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>cornea is exposed, until the science of evolution
explains to us this coincidence.</p>

<p class='c008'>Let us bear in mind that a witty sentence
gave us a general impression in which we were
unable to distinguish the amount of thought-content
from the amount of wit-work; perhaps
even a more significant parallel to it will be
found later.</p>

<h4 class='c016'><em>Pleasure Results from the Technique</em></h4>

<p class='c017'>For our theoretical explanation of the nature
of wit, harmless wit must be of greater value
to us than tendency-wit and shallow wit more
than profound wit. Harmless and shallow
plays on words present to us the problem of
wit in its purest form, because of the good
sense therein and because there is no purposive
factor nor underlying philosophy to confuse
the judgment. With such material our understanding
can make further progress.</p>

<p class='c008'><em>At the end of a dinner to which I had been
invited, a pastry called Roulard was served; it
was a culinary accomplishment which presupposed
a good deal of skill on the part of the
cook. “Is it home-made?” asked one of the
guests. “Oh, yes,” replied the host, “it is a
Home-Roulard”</em> (Home Rule).</p>

<p class='c008'>This time we shall not investigate the technique
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>of this witticism, but shall center our attention
upon another, and that one the most
important factor. As I remember, this improvised
joke delighted all the guests and made us
laugh. In this case, as in countless others, the
feeling of pleasure of the hearer cannot have
originated from any purposive element nor the
thought-content of the wit; so we are forced to
connect the feeling of pleasure with the technique
of wit. The technical means of wit which
we have described, such as condensation, displacement,
indirect expression, etc., have therefore
the faculty to produce a feeling of pleasure
in the hearer, although we cannot as yet
see how they acquired that faculty. By such
easy stages we get the second axiom for the
explanation of wit; the first one (p. 17) states
that the character of wit depends upon the mode
of expression. Let us remember also that the
second axiom has really taught us nothing new.
It merely isolates a fact that was already contained
in a discovery which we made before.
For we recall that whenever it was possible to
reduce the wit by substituting for its verbal
expression another set of words, at the same
time carefully retaining the sense, it not only
eliminated the witty character but also the
laughableness (<i><span lang="de">Lacheffekt</span></i>) that constitutes the
pleasure of wit.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>At present we cannot go further without
first coming to an understanding with our philosophical
authorities.</p>

<p class='c008'>The philosophers who adjudge wit to be a
part of the comic and deal with the latter itself
in the field of æsthetics, characterize the æsthetic
presentation by the following conditions:
that we are not thereby interested in or about
the objects, that we do not need these objects
to satisfy our great wants in life, but that we
are satisfied with the mere contemplation of the
same, and with the pleasure of the thought itself.
“This pleasure, this mode of conception
is purely æsthetical, it depends entirely on itself,
its end is only itself and it fulfills no other
end in life” (K. Fischer, p. 68).</p>

<p class='c008'>We scarcely venture a contradiction to K.
Fischer’s words—perhaps we merely translate
his thoughts into our own mode of expression—when
we insist that the witty activity is, after
all, not to be designated as aimless or purposeless,
since it has for its aim the evocation of
pleasure in the hearer. I doubt whether we
are able to undertake anything which has no
object in view. When we do not use our
psychic apparatus for the fulfillment of one of
our indispensable gratifications, we let it work
for pleasure, and we seek to derive pleasure
from its own activity. I suspect that this is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>really the condition which underlies all æsthetic
thinking, but I know too little about æsthetics
to be willing to support this theory. About
wit, however, I can assert, on the strength of
the two impressions gained before, that it is
an activity whose purpose is to derive pleasure—be
it intellectual or otherwise—from the
psychic processes. To be sure, there are other
activities which accomplish the same thing.
They may be differentiated from each by the
sphere of psychic activity from which they wish
to derive pleasure, or perhaps by the methods
which they use in accomplishing this. At present
we cannot decide this, but we firmly maintain
that at last we have established a connection
between the technique of wit partly controlled
by the tendency to economize (p. 53)
and the production of pleasure.</p>

<p class='c008'>But before we proceed to solve the riddle of
how the technical means of wit-work can produce
pleasure in the hearer, we wish to mention
that, for the sake of simplicity and more lucidity,
we have altogether put out of the way all
tendency-witticisms. Still we must attempt to
explain what the tendencies of wit are and in
what manner wit makes use of these tendencies.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>
  <h4 class='c016'><em>Hostile and Obscene Wit</em></h4>
</div>

<p class='c017'>We are taught above all by an observation
not to put aside the tendency-wit when we
are investigating the origin of the pleasure in
wit. The pleasurable effect of harmless wit
is usually of a moderate nature; all that it
can be expected to produce in the hearer is a
distinct feeling of satisfaction and a slight ripple
of laughter; and as we have shown by fitting
examples (p. 132) at least a part of this
effect is due to the thought-content. The sudden
irresistible outburst of laughter evoked by
the tendency-wit rarely follows the wit without
a tendency. As the technique may be identical
in both, it is fair to assume that by virtue of
its purpose, the tendency-wit has at its disposal
sources of pleasure to which harmless wit has
no access.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is now easy to survey wit-tendencies.
Wherever wit is not a means to its end, i. e.,
harmless, it puts itself in the service of but two
tendencies which may themselves be united
under one viewpoint; it is either <em>hostile</em> wit
serving as an aggression, satire, or defense, or
it is <em>obscene</em> wit serving as a sexual exhibition.
Again it is to be observed that the technical
form of wit—be it a word- or thought-witticism—bears
no relation to these two tendencies.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>It is a much more complicated matter to
show in what way wit serves these tendencies.
In this investigation I wish to present first
not the hostile but the exhibition wit. The latter
has indeed very seldom been deemed worthy
of an investigation, as if an aversion had transferred
itself here from the material to the subject;
however, we shall not allow ourselves to
be misled thereby, for we shall soon touch
upon a detail in wit which promises to throw
light on more than one obscure point.</p>

<p class='c008'>We all know what is meant by a “smutty”
joke. It is the intentional bringing into prominence
of sexual facts or relations through
speech. However, this definition is no sounder
than other definitions. A lecture on the anatomy
of the sexual organs or on the physiology
of reproduction need not, in spite of this definition,
have anything in common with an obscenity.
It must be added that the smutty joke is
directed toward a certain person who excites
one sexually, and who becomes cognizant
of the speaker’s excitement by listening to the
smutty joke, and thereby in turn becomes sexually
excited. Instead of becoming sexually
excited the listener may react with shame and
embarrassment, which merely signifies a reaction
against the excitement and indirectly an
admission of the same. The smutty joke was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>originally directed against the woman and is
comparable to an attempt at seduction. If a
man tells or listens to obscene jokes in male
society, the original situation, which cannot be
realized on account of social inhibitions, is
thereby also represented. Whoever laughs at
a smutty joke does the same as the spectator
who laughs at a sexual aggression.</p>

<p class='c008'>The sexual element which is at the basis of
the obscene joke comprises more than that
which is peculiar to both sexes, and goes beyond
that which is common to both sexes, it
is connected with all these things that cause
shame, and includes the whole domain of the
excrementitious. However, this was the sexual
domain of childhood, where the imagination
fancied a cloaca, so to speak, within which the
sexual elements were either badly or not at all
differentiated from the excrementitious.<a id='r39'></a><a href='#f39' class='c007'><sup>[39]</sup></a> In
the whole mental domain of the psychology of
the neuroses, the sexual still includes the excrementitious,
and it is understood in the old,
infantile sense.</p>

<p class='c008'>The smutty joke is like the denudation of a
person of the opposite sex toward whom the
joke is directed. Through the utterance of obscene
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>words the person attacked is forced to
picture the parts of the body in question, or
the sexual act, and is shown that the aggressor
himself pictures the same thing. There is no
doubt that the original motive of the smutty
joke was the pleasure of seeing the sexual displayed.</p>

<p class='c008'>It will only help to clarify the subject if
here we go back to the fundamentals. One of
the primitive components of our libido is the
desire to see the sexual exposed. Perhaps this
itself is a development—a substitution for the
desire to touch which is assumed to be the primary
pleasure. As it often happens, the desire
to see has here also replaced the desire to
touch.<a id='r40'></a><a href='#f40' class='c007'><sup>[40]</sup></a> The libido for looking and touching is
found in every person in two forms, active and
passive, or masculine and feminine; and in accordance
with the preponderance of sex characteristics
it develops preponderately in one or
the other direction. In young children one can
readily observe the desire to exhibit themselves
nude. If the germ of this desire does not experience
the usual fate of being covered up and
repressed, it develops into a mania for exhibitionism,
a familiar perversion among grown-up
men. In women the passive desire to exhibit
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>is almost regularly covered by the masked reaction
of sexual modesty; despite this, however,
remnants of this desire may always be seen in
women’s dress. I need only mention how flexible
and variable convention and circumstances
make that remaining portion of exhibitionism
still allowed to women.</p>

<h4 class='c016'><em>The Transformation of the Obscenity into Obscene Wit</em></h4>

<p class='c017'>In the case of men a great part of this striving
to exhibit remains as a part of the libido
and serves to initiate the sexual act. If this
striving asserts itself on first meeting the
woman it must make use of speech for two motives.
First, in order to make itself known to
the woman; and secondly, because the awakening
of the imagination through speech puts
the woman herself in a corresponding excitement
and awakens in her the desire to passive
exhibitionism. This speech of courtship is not
yet smutty, but may pass over into the same.
Wherever the yieldingness of the woman manifests
itself quickly, smutty speech is short-lived,
for it gives way to the sexual act. It
is different if the rapid yielding of the woman
cannot be counted upon, but instead there appears
the defense reaction. In that case the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>sexually exciting speech changes into obscene
wit as its own end; as the sexual aggression
is inhibited in its progress towards the act, it
lingers at the evocation of the excitement and
derives pleasure from the indications of the
same in the woman. In this process the aggression
changes its character in the same way
as any libidinous impulse confronted by a
hindrance; it becomes distinctly hostile and
cruel, and utilizes the sadistical components of
the sexual impulse against the hindrance.</p>

<p class='c008'>Thus the unyieldingness of the woman is
therefore the next condition for the development
of smutty wit; to be sure, this resistance
must be of the kind to indicate merely a deferment
and make it appear that further efforts
will not be in vain. The ideal case of such
resistance on the part of the woman usually results
from the simultaneous presence of another
man, a third person, whose presence almost
excludes the immediate yielding of the woman.
This third person soon becomes of the greatest
importance for the development of the smutty
wit, but next to him the presence of the
woman must be taken account of. Among
rural people or in the ordinary hostelry one
can observe that not till the waitress or the
hostess approaches the guests does the obscene
wit come out; in a higher order of society just
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>the opposite happens, here the presence of a
woman puts an end to smutty talk. The men
reserve this kind of conversation, which originally
presupposed the presence of bashful
women, until they are alone, “by themselves.”
Thus gradually the spectator, now turned the
listener, takes the place of the woman as the
object of the smutty joke, and through such
a change the smutty joke already approaches
the character of wit.</p>

<p class='c008'>Henceforth our attention may be centered
upon two factors, first upon the rôle that the
third person—the listener—plays, and secondly,
upon the intrinsic conditions of the smutty joke
itself.</p>

<p class='c008'>Tendency-wit usually requires three persons.
Besides the one who makes the wit there is a
second person who is taken as the object of
the hostile or sexual aggression, and a third
person in whom the purpose of the wit to produce
pleasure is fulfilled. We shall later on
inquire into the deeper motive of this relationship,
for the present we shall adhere to the
fact which states that it is not the maker of
the wit who laughs about it and enjoys its
pleasurable effect, but it is the idle listener who
does. The same relationship exists among the
three persons connected with the smutty joke.
The process may be described as follows: As
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>soon as the libidinous impulse of the first person,
to satisfy himself through the woman, is
blocked, he immediately develops a hostile attitude
towards this second person and takes the
originally intruding third person as his confederate.
Through the obscene speech of the first
person the woman is exposed before the third
person, who as a listener is fascinated by the
easy gratification of his own libido.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is curious that common people so
thoroughly enjoy such smutty talk, and that it
is a never-lacking activity of cheerful humor.
It is also worthy of notice that in this complicated
process which shows so many characteristics
of tendency-wit, no formal demands, such
as characterize wit, are made upon “smutty
wit.” The unveiled nudity affords pleasure to
the first and makes the third person laugh.</p>

<p class='c008'>Not until we come to the refined and cultured
does the formal determination of wit
arise. The obscenity becomes witty and is tolerated
only if it is witty. The technical means
of which it mostly makes use is allusion, i.e.,
substitution through a trifle, something remotely
related, which the listener reconstructs
in his imagination as a full-fledged and direct
obscenity. The greater the disproportion between
what is directly offered in the obscenity
and what is necessarily aroused by it in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>mind of the listener, the finer is the witticism
and the higher it may venture in good society.
Besides the coarse and delicate allusions, the
witty obscenity also utilizes all other means of
word- and thought-wit, as can be easily demonstrated
by examples.</p>

<h4 class='c016'><em>The Function of Wit in the Service of the Tendency</em></h4>

<p class='c017'>It now becomes comprehensible what wit accomplishes
through this service of its tendency.
It makes possible the gratification of a craving
(lewd or hostile) despite a hindrance which
stands in the way; it eludes the hindrance and
so derives pleasure from a source that has become
inaccessible on account of the hindrance.
The hindrance in the way is really nothing
more than the higher degree of culture and education
which correspondingly increases the inability
of the woman to tolerate the stark sex.
The woman thought of as present in the final
situation is still considered present, or her influence
acts as a deterrent to the men even in
her absence. One often notices how cultured
men are influenced by the company of girls of
a lower station in life to change witty obscenities
to broad smut.</p>

<p class='c008'>The power which renders it difficult or impossible
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>for the woman, and in a lesser degree
for the man, to enjoy unveiled obscenities we
call “repression,” and we recognize in it the
same psychic process which keeps from consciousness
in severe nervous attacks whole complexes
of emotions with their resultant affects,
and has shown itself to be the principal factor
in the causation of the so-called psychoneuroses.
We acknowledge to culture and higher civilization
an important influence in the development
of repressions, and assume that under
these conditions there has come about a change
in our psychic organization which may also
have been brought along as an inherited disposition.
In consequence of it, what was once
accepted as pleasureful is now counted unacceptable
and is rejected by means of all the
psychic forces. Owing to the repression
brought about by civilization many primary
pleasures are now disapproved by the censor
and lost. But the human psyche finds renunciation
very difficult; hence we discover that
tendency-wit furnishes us with a means to make
the renunciation retrogressive and thus to regain
what has been lost. When we laugh over
a delicately obscene witticism, we laugh at the
identical thing which causes laughter in the ill-bred
man when he hears a coarse, obscene joke;
in both cases the pleasure comes from the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>same source. The coarse, obscene joke, however,
could not incite us to laughter, because
it would cause us shame or would seem to us
disgusting; we can laugh only when wit comes
to our aid.</p>

<p class='c008'>What we had presumed in the beginning
seems to have been confirmed, namely, that
tendency-wit has access to other sources of
pleasure than harmless wit, in which all the
pleasure is somehow dependent upon the technique.
We can also reiterate that owing to
our feelings we are in no position to distinguish
in tendency-wit what part of the pleasure
originates from the technique and what
part from the tendency. <em>Strictly speaking, we
do not know what we are laughing about.</em> In
all obscene jokes we succumb to striking mistakes
of judgment about the “goodness” of
the joke as far as it depends upon formal conditions;
the technique of these jokes is often
very poor while their laughing effect is
enormous.</p>

<h4 class='c016'><em>Invectives Made Possible Through Wit</em></h4>

<p class='c017'>We next wish to determine whether the rôle
of wit in the service of the hostile tendency
is the same.</p>

<p class='c008'>Right from the start we meet with similar
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>conditions. Since our individual childhood
and the childhood of human civilization, our
hostile impulses towards our fellow-beings have
been subjected to the same restrictions and the
same progressive repressions as our sexual
strivings. We have not yet progressed so far
as to love our enemies, or to extend to them
our left cheek after we are smitten on the
right. Furthermore, all moral codes about the
subjection of active hatred bear even to-day
the clearest indications that they were originally
meant for a small community of clansmen. As
we all may consider ourselves members of some
nation, we permit ourselves for the most part
to forget these restrictions in matters touching
a foreign people. But within our own circles
we have nevertheless made progress in the
mastery of hostile emotions. Lichtenberg
drastically puts it when he says: “Where nowadays
one says, ‘I beg your pardon,’ formerly
one had recourse to a cuff on the ear.” Violent
hostility, no longer tolerated by law, has
been replaced by verbal invectives, and the better
understanding of the concatenation of human
emotions robs us, through its consequential
“<i><span lang="fr">Tout comprendre c’est tout pardonner</span></i>,”
more and more of the capacity to become angry
at our fellowman who is in our way. Having
been endowed with a strong hostile disposition
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>in our childhood, higher personal civilization
teaches us later that it is undignified to use
abusive language; even where combat is still
permitted, the number of things which may be
used as means of combat has been markedly
restricted. Society, as the third and dispassionate
party in the combat to whose interest it
is to safeguard personal safety, prevents us
from expressing our hostile feelings in action;
and hence, as in sexual aggression, there has
developed a new technique of invectives, the
aim of which is to enlist this third person
against our enemy. By belittling and humbling
our enemy, by scorning and ridiculing
him, we indirectly obtain the pleasure of his
defeat by the laughter of the third person,
the inactive spectator.</p>

<p class='c008'>We are now prepared for the rôle that wit
plays in hostile aggression. Wit permits us
to make our enemy ridiculous through that
which we could not utter loudly or consciously
on account of existing hindrances; in other
words, <em>wit affords us the means of surmounting
restrictions and of opening up otherwise
inaccessible pleasure-sources</em>. Moreover, the
listener will be induced by the gain in pleasure
to take our part, even if he is not altogether
convinced,—just as we on other occasions,
when fascinated by harmless witticism,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>were wont to overestimate the substance of the
sentence wittily expressed. “To prejudice
the laughter in one’s own favor” is a completely
pertinent saying in the German language.</p>

<p class='c008'>One may recall Mr. N.’s witticism given in the
last chapter (p. 28). It is of an insulting nature,
as if the author wished to shout loudly:
But the minister of agriculture is himself an ox!
But he, as a man of culture, could not put
his opinion in this form. He therefore appealed
to wit which assured his opinion a reception
at the hands of the listeners which,
in spite of its amount of truth, never would
have been received if in an unwitty form.
Brill cites an excellent example of a similar
kind: <em>Wendell Phillips, according to a recent
biography by Dr. Lorenzo Sears, was on one
occasion lecturing in Ohio, and while on a
railroad journey going to keep one of his appointments
met in the car a number of clergymen
returning from some sort of convention.
One of the ministers, feeling called upon to
approach Mr. Phillips, asked him, “Are you
Mr. Phillips?” “I am, sir.” “Are you trying
to free the niggers?” “Yes, sir; I am an
abolitionist.” “Well, why do you preach your
doctrines up here? Why don’t you go over
into Kentucky?” “Excuse me, are you a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>preacher?” “I am, sir.” “Are you trying to
save souls from hell?” “Yes, sir, that’s my
business.” “Well, why don’t you go there?”</em>
The assailant hurried into the smoker amid a
roar of unsanctified laughter. This anecdote
nicely illustrates the tendency-wit in the
service of hostile aggression. The minister’s
behavior was offensive and irritating, yet
Wendell Phillips as a man of culture could
not defend himself in the same manner as a
common, ill-bred person would have done, and
as his inner feelings must have prompted him
to do. The only alternative under the circumstances
would have been to take the affront
in silence, had not wit showed him the way,
and enabled him by the technical means of
unification to turn the tables on his assailant.
He not only belittled him and turned him
into ridicule, but by his clever retort, “Well,
why don’t you go there?” fascinated the other
clergymen, and thus brought them to his side.</p>

<p class='c008'>Although the hindrance to the aggression
which the wit helped to elude was in these
cases of an inner nature—the æsthetic resistance
against insulting—it may at other
times be of a purely outer nature. So it was
in the case when Serenissimus asked the
stranger who had a striking resemblance to
himself: “Was your mother ever in my home?”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>and he received the ready reply, “No, but
my father was.” The stranger would certainly
have felled the imprudent inquirer who
dared to make an ignominious allusion to the
memory of his mother; but this imprudent
person was Serenissimus, who may not be felled
and not even insulted unless one wishes to
pay for this revenge with his life. The only
thing left was to swallow the insult in silence;
but luckily wit pointed out the way of requiting
the insult without personally imperiling
one’s self. It was accomplished simply by
treating the allusion with the technical means
of unification and employing it against the
aggressor. The impression of wit is here so
thoroughly determined by the tendency that
in view of the witty rejoinder we are inclined
to forget that the aggressor’s inquiry is itself
made witty by allusion.</p>

<h4 class='c016'><em>Rebellion Against Authority Through Wit</em></h4>

<p class='c017'>The prevention of abuse or insulting retorts
through outer circumstances is so often the
case that tendency-wit is used with special
preference as a weapon of attack or criticism
of superiors who claim to be an authority.
Wit then serves as a resistance against such
authority and as an escape from its pressure.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>In this factor, too, lies the charm of caricature,
at which we laugh even if it is badly done
simply because we consider its resistance to
authority a great merit.</p>

<p class='c008'>If we keep in mind that tendency-wit is so
well adapted as a weapon of attack upon what
is great, dignified, and mighty, that which is
shielded by internal hindrances or external
circumstance against direct disparagement, we
are forced to a special conception of certain
groups of witticisms which seem to occupy
themselves with inferior and powerless persons.
I am referring to the marriage-agent stories,—with
a few of which we have become familiar
in the investigation of the manifold techniques
of thought-wit. In some of these examples,
“But she is deaf, too!” and “Who in the world
would ever lend these people anything!” the
agent was derided as a careless and thoughtless
person who becomes comical because the truth
escapes his lips automatically, as it were. But
does on the one hand what we have learned
about the nature of tendency-wit, and on the
other hand the amount of satisfaction in these
stories, harmonize with the misery of the persons
at whom the joke seems to be pointed?
Are these worthy opponents of the wit? Or,
is it not more plausible to suppose that the
wit puts the agent in the foreground only in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>order to strike at something more important;
does it, as the saying goes, strike the saddle
pack, when it is meant for the mule? This
conception can really not be rejected.</p>

<p class='c008'>The above-mentioned interpretation of the
marriage-agent stories admits of a continuation.
It is true that I need not enter into
them, that I can content myself with seeing
the farcical in these stories, and can dispute
their witty character. However, such subjective
determination of wit actually exists. We
have now become cognizant of it and shall
later on have to investigate it. It means that
only that is a witticism which I wish to consider
as such. What may be wit to me, may
be only an amusing story to another. But if
a witticism admits of doubt, that can be due
only to the fact that it is possessed of a show-side,—in
our examples it happens to be a
façade of the comic,—upon which one may be
satisfied to bestow a single glance while another
may attempt to peep behind. We also suspect
that this façade is intended to dazzle the prying
glance which is to say that such stories
have something to conceal.</p>

<p class='c008'>At all events, if our marriage-agent stories
are witticisms at all, they are all the better
witticisms because, thanks to their façade, they
are in a position to conceal not only what they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>have to say but also that they have something—forbidden—to
say. But the continuation of
the interpretation, which reveals this hidden
part and shows that these stories having a comical
façade are tendency-witticisms, would be
as follows: Every one who allows the truth to
escape his lips in an unguarded moment is
really pleased to have rid himself of this
thought. This is a correct and far-reaching
psychological insight. Without the inner assent
no one would allow himself to be overpowered
by the automatism which here brings the
truth to light.<a id='r41'></a><a href='#f41' class='c007'><sup>[41]</sup></a> The marriage agent is thus
transformed from a ludicrous personage into
an object deserving of pity and sympathy.
How blest must be the man, able at last to unburden
himself of the weight of dissimulation,
if he immediately seizes the first opportunity
to shout out the last fragment of truth! As
soon as he sees that his case is lost, that the
prospective bride does not suit the young man,
he gladly betrays the secret that the girl has
still another blemish which the young man had
overlooked, or he makes use of the chance to
present a conclusive argument in detail in
order to express his contempt for the people
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>who employ him: “Who in the world would
ever lend these people anything!” The ludicrousness
of the whole thing now reverts upon
the parents,—hardly mentioned in the story,—who
consider such deceptions justified to clutch
a man for their daughter; it also reflects upon
the wretched state of the girls who get married
through such contrivances, and upon the
want of dignity of the marriage contracted
after such preliminaries. The agent is the
right person to express such criticisms, for he
is best acquainted with these abuses; but he
may not raise his voice, because he is a poor
man whose livelihood depends altogether on
turning these abuses to his advantage. But the
same conflict is found in the national spirit
which has given rise to these and similar
stories; for he is aware that the holiness of wedlock
suffers severely by reference to some of
the methods of marriage-making.</p>

<p class='c008'>We recall also the observation made during
the investigation of wit-technique, namely, that
absurdity in wit frequently stands for derision
and criticism in the thought behind the witticism,
wherein the wit-work follows the dream-work.
This state of affairs, we find, is here
once more confirmed. That the derision and
criticism are not aimed at the agent, who appears
in the former examples only as the whipping
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>boy of the joke, is shown by another series
in which the agent, on the contrary, is pictured
as a superior person whose dialectics are a
match for any difficulty. They are stories
whose façades are logical instead of comical—they
are sophistic thought-witticisms. In one
of them (p. 83) the agent knows how to circumvent
the limping of the bride by stating
that in her case it is at least “a finished job”;
another woman with straight limbs would be
in constant danger of falling and breaking
a leg, which would be followed by sickness,
pains, and doctor’s fees—all of which can be
avoided by marrying the one already limping.
Again in another example (p. 81) the agent
is clever enough to refute by good arguments
each of the whole series of the suitor’s
objections against the bride; only to the
last, which cannot be glossed over, he rejoins,
“Do you expect her to have no blemishes
at all?” as if the other objections had
not left behind an important remnant. It is
not difficult to pick out the weak points of the
arguments in both examples, a thing which we
have done during the investigation of the technique.
But now something else interests us.
If the agent’s speech is endowed with such a
strong semblance of logic, which on more careful
examination proves to be merely a semblance,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>then the truth must be lurking in the
fact that the witticism adjudges the agent to
be right. The thought does not dare to admit
that he is right in all seriousness, and replaces
it by the semblance which the wit brings forth;
but here, as it often happens, the jest betrays
the seriousness of it. We shall not err if we
assume that all stories with logical façades
really mean what they assert even if these assertions
are deliberately falsely motivated.
Only this use of sophism for the veiled presentation
of the truth endows it with the character
of wit, which is mainly dependent upon
tendency. What these two stories wish to indicate
is that the suitor really makes himself
ridiculous when he collects together so sedulously
the individual charms of the bride which
are transient after all, and when he forgets at
the same time that he must be prepared to
take as his wife a human being with inevitable
faults; whereas, the only virtue which might
make tolerable marriage with the more or less
imperfect personality of the woman,—mutual
attachment and willingness for affectionate
adaptation,—is not once mentioned in the
whole affair.</p>

<p class='c008'>Ridicule of the suitor as seen in these examples
in which the agent quite correctly assumes
the rôle of superiority, is much more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>clearly depicted in other examples. The more
pointed the stories, the less wit-technique they
contain; they are, as it were, merely border-line
cases of wit with whose technique they
have only the façade-formation in common.
However, in view of the same tendency and
the concealment of the same behind the façade,
they obtain the full effect of wit. The poverty
of technical means makes it clear also that
many witticisms of that kind cannot dispense
with the comic element of jargon which acts
similarly to wit-technique without great sacrifices.</p>

<p class='c008'>The following is such a story, which with all
the force of tendency-wit obviates all traces
of that technique. <em>The agent asks: “What
are you looking for in your bride?” The
reply is: “She must be pretty, she must be
rich, and she must be cultured.” “Very well,”
was the agent’s rejoinder. “But what you
want will make three matches.”</em> Here the reproach
is no longer embodied in wit, but is
made directly to the man.</p>

<p class='c008'>In all the preceding examples the veiled aggression
was still directed against persons; in
the marriage-agent jokes it is directed against
all the parties involved in the betrothal—the
bridegroom, bride, and her parents. The object
of attack by wit may equally well be institutions,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>persons, in so far as they may act
as agents of these, moral or religious precepts,
or even philosophies of life which enjoy so
much respect that they can be challenged in no
other way than under the guise of a witticism,
and one that is veiled by a façade at that. No
matter how few the themes upon which tendency-wit
may play, its forms and investments
are manifold. I believe that we shall do well
to designate this species of tendency-wit by a
special name. To decide what name will be
appropriate is possible only after analyzing a
few examples of this kind.</p>

<h4 class='c016'><em>The Witty Cynicism</em></h4>

<p class='c017'>I recall the two little stories about the impecunious
gourmand who was caught eating
“salmon with mayonnaise,” and about the tippling
tutor; these witty stories, which we have
learned to regard as sophistical displacement-wit,
I shall continue to analyze. We have
learned since then that when the semblance of
logic is attached to the façade of a story, the
actual thought is as follows: The man is
right; but on account of the opposing contradiction,
I did not dare to admit the fact except
for one point in which his error is easily
demonstrable. The “point” chosen is the correct
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>compromise between his right and his
wrong; this is really no decision, but bespeaks
the conflict within ourselves. Both stories are
simply epicurean. They say, Yes, the man is
right; nothing is greater than pleasure, and it
is fairly immaterial in what manner one procures
it. This sounds frightfully immoral, and
perhaps it is, but fundamentally it is nothing
more than the “<em>Carpe diem</em>” of the poet who
refers to the uncertainty of life and the bareness
of virtuous renunciation. If we are repelled
by the idea that the man in the joke
about “salmon with mayonnaise” is in the
right, then it is merely due to the fact that it
illustrates the sound sense of the man in indulging
himself—an indulgence which seems to
us wholly unnecessary. In reality each one of
us has experienced hours and times during
which he has admitted the justice of this
philosophy of life and has reproached our system
of morality for knowing only how to
make claims upon us without reimbursing us.
Since we no longer lend credence to the idea
of a hereafter in which all former renunciations
are supposed to be rewarded by gratification—(there
are very few pious persons if one
makes renunciation the password of faith)—“<em>Carpe
diem</em>” becomes the first admonition. I
am quite ready to postpone the gratification,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>but how do I know whether I shall still be
alive to-morrow?</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“<span lang="it">Di doman’ non c’e certezza.</span>”<a id='r42'></a><a href='#f42' class='c007'><sup>[42]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>I am quite willing to give up all the paths
to gratification interdicted by society, but am
I sure that society will reward me for this renunciation
by opening for me—even after a
certain delay—one of the permitted paths?
One can plainly tell what these witticisms
whisper, namely, that the wishes and desires of
man have a right to make themselves perceptible
next to our pretentious and inconsiderate
morality. And in our times it has been said in
emphatic and striking terms that this morality
is merely the selfish precept of the few rich
and mighty who can gratify their desires at
any time without deferment. As long as the art
of healing has not succeeded in safeguarding
our lives, and as long as the social organizations
do not do more towards making conditions
more agreeable, just so long cannot the
voice within us which is striving against the
demands of morality, be stifled. Every honest
person finally makes this admission—at least
to himself. The decision in this conflict is possible
only through the roundabout way of a
new understanding. One must be able to knit
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>one’s life so closely to that of others, and to
form such an intimate identification with
others, that the shortening of one’s own term
of life becomes surmountable; one should not
unlawfully fulfill the demands of one’s own
needs, but should leave them unfulfilled, because
only the continuance of so many unfulfilled
demands can develop the power to recast
the social order. But not all personal
needs allow themselves to be displaced in such
a manner and transferred to others, nor is
there a universal and definite solution of the
conflict.</p>

<p class='c008'>We now know how to designate the witticisms
just discussed; they are cynical witticisms,
and what they conceal are cynicisms.</p>

<p class='c008'>Among the institutions which cynical wit is
wont to attack there is none more important
and more completely protected by moral precepts,
and yet more inviting of attack, than the
institution of marriage. Most of the cynical
jokes are directed against it. For no demand
is more personal than that made upon sexual
freedom, and nowhere has civilization attempted
to exert a more stringent suppression
than in the realm of sexuality. For our purposes
a single example suffices: the “Entries
in the Album of Prince Carnival” mentioned
on page 108.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>“<em>A wife is like an umbrella, at worst one
may always take a cab.</em>”</p>

<p class='c008'>We have already elucidated the complicated
technique of this example; it is a puzzling and
seemingly impossible comparison which however,
as we now see, is not in itself witty; it
shows besides an allusion (cab = public conveyance),
and as the strongest technical means
it also shows an omission which serves to make
it still more unintelligible. The comparison
may be worked out in the following manner.
A man marries in order to guard himself
against the temptations of sensuality, but it
then turns out that after all marriage affords
no gratification for one of stronger needs, just
as one takes along an umbrella for protection
against rain only to get wet in spite of it. In
both cases one must search for better protection;
in one case one must take a public cab,
in the other women procurable for money.
Now the wit has almost entirely been replaced
by cynicism. That marriage is not the organization
which can satisfy a man’s sexuality, one
does not dare to say loudly and frankly unless
indeed it be one like Christian v. Ehrenfels,<a id='r43'></a><a href='#f43' class='c007'><sup>[43]</sup></a>
who is forced to it by the love of truth and the
zeal of reform. The strength of this witticism
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>lies in the fact that it has expressed the
thought even though it had to be done through
all sorts of roundabout ways.</p>

<h4 class='c016'><em>Cynical Witticisms and Self-criticism</em></h4>

<p class='c017'>A particularly favorable case for tendency-wit
results if the intended criticism of the
inner resistance is directed against one’s own
person, or, more carefully expressed, against a
person in whom one takes interest, that is, a
composite personality such as one’s own people.
This determination of self-criticism may
make clear why it is that a number of the most
excellent jokes of which we have shown here
many specimens should have sprung into existence
from the soil of Jewish national life.
They are stories which were invented by Jews
themselves and which are directed against Jewish
peculiarities. The Jewish jokes made up
by non-Jews are nearly all brutal buffooneries
in which the wit is spared by the fact that the
Jew appears as a comic figure to a stranger.
The Jewish jokes which originate with Jews
admit this, but they know their real shortcomings
as well as their merits, and the interest
of the person himself in the thing to be criticised
produces the subjective determination of
the wit-work which would otherwise be difficult
to bring about. Incidentally I do not know
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>whether one often finds a people that makes
merry so unreservedly over its own shortcomings.</p>

<p class='c008'>As an illustration I can point to the story
cited on page 112 in which the Jew in the train
immediately abandons all sense of decency of
deportment as soon as he recognizes the new
arrival in his coupé as his coreligionist. We
have come to know this joke as an illustration
by means of a detail—representation through
a trifle; it is supposed to represent the democratic
mode of thought of the Jew who recognizes
no difference between master and servant,
but unfortunately this also disturbs discipline
and co-operation. Another especially
interesting series of jokes presents the relationship
between the poor and the rich Jews: their
heroes are the “shnorrer,”<a id='r44'></a><a href='#f44' class='c007'><sup>[44]</sup></a> and the charitable
gentleman or the baron. <em>The shnorrer, who
was a regular Sunday-dinner guest at a certain
house, appeared one day accompanied by
a young stranger, who prepared to seat himself
at the table. “Who is that?” demanded the
host. “He became my son-in-law last week,”
was the reply, “and I have agreed to supply
his board for the first year.”</em> The tendency of
these stories is always the same, and is most
distinctly shown in the following story. <em>The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>shnorrer supplicates the baron for money to
visit the bathing resort Ostend, as the physician
has ordered him to take sea baths for
his ailment. The baron remarks that Ostend
is an especially expensive resort, and that a
less fashionable place would do just as well.
But the shnorrer rejects that proposition by
saying, “Herr Baron, nothing is too expensive
for my health.”</em> That is an excellent displacement-witticism
which we could have taken as
a model of its kind. The baron is evidently
anxious to save his money, but the shnorrer replies
as if the baron’s money were his own,
which he may then consider secondary to his
health. One is forced to laugh at the insolence
of the demand, but these jokes are exceptionally
unequipped with a façade to becloud the
understanding. The truth is that the shnorrer
who mentally treats the rich man’s money as
his own, really possesses almost the right to
this mistake, according to the sacred codes of
the Jews. Naturally the resistance which is
responsible for this joke is directed against the
law which even the pious find very oppressing.</p>

<p class='c008'>Another story relates <em>how on the steps of a
rich man’s house a shnorrer met one of his own
kind. The latter counseled him to depart, saying,
“Do not go up to-day, the Baron is out
of sorts and refuses to give any one more than
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>a dollar.” “I will go up anyway,” replied the
first. “Why in the world should I make him,
a present of a dollar? Is he making me any
presents?”</em></p>

<p class='c008'>This witticism makes use of the technique of
absurdity by permitting the shnorrer to declare
that the baron gives him nothing at the same
moment in which he is preparing to beg him
for the donation. But the absurdity is only
apparent, for it is almost true that the rich
man gives him nothing, since he is obligated by
the mandate to give alms, and strictly speaking
must be thankful that the shnorrer gives
him an opportunity to be charitable. The
ordinary, bourgeois conception of alms is at
cross-purposes with the religious one; it openly
revolts against the religious conception in the
<em>story about the baron who, having been deeply
touched by the shnorrer’s tale of woe, rang
for his servants and said: “Throw him out of
the house; he is breaking my heart.”</em> This obvious
exposition of the tendency again creates
a case of border-line wit. From the no longer
witty complaint: “It is really no advantage to
be a rich man among Jews. The foreign
misery does not grant one the pleasure of one’s
own fortune,” these last stories are distinguished
only by the illustration of a single situation.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>Other stories as the following, which, technically
again presenting border-lines of wit,
have their origin in a deeply pessimistic cynicism.
<em>A patient whose hearing was defective
consulted a physician who made the correct
diagnosis, namely, that the patient probably
drank too much whiskey and consequently was
becoming deaf. He advised him to desist from
drinking and the patient promised to follow
his advice. Some time thereafter the doctor
met him on the street and inquired in a loud
voice about his condition. “Thank you, Doctor,”
was the reply, “there is no necessity for
speaking so loudly, I have given up drinking
whiskey and consequently I hear perfectly.”
Some time afterwards they met again. The
doctor again inquired into his condition in the
usual voice, but noticed that he did not make
himself understood. “It seems to me that you
are deaf again because you have returned to
drinking whiskey,” shouted the doctor in the
patient’s ear. “Perhaps you are right,” answered
the latter, “I have taken to drinking
again, and I shall tell you why. As long as I
did not drink I could hear, but all that I
heard was not as good as the whiskey.”</em>
Technically this joke is nothing more than an
illustration. The jargon and the ability of the
<em>raconteur</em> must aid the producing of laughter.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>But behind it there lies the sad question, “Is
not the man right in his choice?”</p>

<p class='c008'>It is the manifold hopeless misery of the
Jews to which these pessimistical stories allude,
which urged me to add them to tendency-wit.</p>

<h4 class='c016'><em>Critical and Blasphemous Witticisms</em></h4>

<p class='c017'>Other jokes, cynical in a similar sense,
and not only stories about Jews, attack religious
dogmas and the belief in God Himself.
The story about the “telepathic look of the
rabbi,” whose technique consisted in the faulty
thinking which made phantasy equal to reality,
(the conception of displacement is also tenable)
is such a cynical or critical witticism directed
against miracle-workers and also, surely,
against belief in miracles. Heine is reported
to have made a directly blasphemous joke as
he lay dying. <i>When the kindly priest commended
him to God’s mercy and inspired him
with the hope that God would forgive him his
sins, he replied: “<span lang="fr">Bien sûr qu’il me pardonnera;
c’est son métier.</span>”</i> That is a derogatory
comparison; technically its value lies only in
the allusion, for a métier—business or vocation—is
plied either by a craftsman or a physician,
and what is more he has only a single métier.
The strength of the wit, however, lies in its
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>tendency. The joke is intended to mean nothing
else, but: Certainly he will forgive me; that
is what he is here for, and for no other purpose
have I engaged him (just as one retains
one’s doctor or one’s lawyer). Thus, the helpless
dying man is still conscious of the fact that
he has created God for himself and has clothed
Him with the power in order to make use of
Him as occasion arises. The so-called creature
makes itself known as the Creator only a short
time before his extinction.</p>

<h4 class='c016'><em>Skeptical Wit</em></h4>

<p class='c017'>To the three kinds of tendency-wit discussed
so far—exhibitionistic or obscene wit, aggressive
or hostile wit, and cynical wit (critical, blasphemous)—I
desire to add a fourth and the
most uncommon of all, whose character can be
elucidated by a good example.</p>

<p class='c008'><em>Two Jews met in a train at a Galician railway
station. “Where are you traveling?”
asked one. “To Cracow,” was the reply. “Now
see here, what a liar you are!” said the first
one, bristling. “When you say that you are
traveling to Cracow, you really wish me to believe
that you are traveling to Lemberg. Well,
but I am sure that you are really traveling to
Cracow, so why lie about it?”</em></p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>This precious story, which creates an impression
of exaggerated subtlety, evidently operates
by means of the technique of absurdity.
The second Jew has put himself in the way of
being called a liar because he has said that he
is traveling to Cracow, which is his real goal!
However, this strong technical means—absurdity—is
paired here with another technique—representation
through the opposite, for, according
to the uncontradicted assertion of the
first, the second one is lying when he speaks
the truth, and speaks the truth by means of a
lie. However, the more earnest content of this
joke is the question of the conditions of truth;
again the joke points to a problem and makes
use of the uncertainty of one of our commonest
notions. Does it constitute truth if one
describes things as they are and does not concern
himself with the way the hearers will interpret
what one has said? Or is this merely
Jesuitical truth, and does not the real truthfulness
consist much more in having a regard for
the hearer and of furnishing him an exact picture
of his own mind? I consider jokes of this
type sufficiently different from the others to
assign them a special place. What they attack
is not a person nor an institution, but the certainty
of our very knowledge—one of our
speculative gifts. Hence the name “skeptical”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>witticism will be the most expressive for
them.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the course of our discussion of the tendencies
of wit we have gotten perhaps many an
elucidation and certainly found numerous incentives
for further investigations. But the results
of this chapter combine with those of the preceding
chapter to form a difficult problem. If
it be true that the pleasure created by wit is dependent
upon the technique on one hand and
upon the tendency on the other hand, under
what common point of view can these two utterly
different pleasure-sources of wit he
united?</p>

  <h3 class='c001'>IV<br> <span class='c015'>THE PLEASURE MECHANISM AND THE PSYCHOGENESIS OF WIT</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c006'>We can now definitely assert that we know
from what sources the peculiar pleasure arises
furnished us by wit. We know that we can be
easily misled to mistake our sense of satisfaction
experienced through the thought-content
of the sentence for the actual pleasure derived
from the wit, on the other hand, the latter itself
has two intrinsic sources, namely, the wit-technique
and the wit-tendency. What we now
desire to ascertain is the manner in which
pleasure originates from these sources and the
mechanism of this resultant pleasure.</p>

<p class='c008'>It seems to us that the desired explanation
can be more easily ascertained in tendency-wit
than in harmless wit. We shall therefore commence
with the former.</p>

<p class='c008'>The pleasure in tendency-wit results from
the fact that a tendency, whose gratification
would otherwise remain unfulfilled, is actually
gratified. That such gratification is a source
of pleasure is self-evident without further discussion.
But the manner in which wit brings
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>about gratification is connected with special
conditions from which we may perhaps gain
further information. Here two cases must be
differentiated. The simpler case is the one in
which the gratification of the tendency is opposed
by an external hindrance which is eluded
by the wit. This process we found, for example,
in the reply which Serenissimus received
to his query whether the mother of the stranger
he addressed had ever sojourned in his home,
and likewise in the question of the art critic
who asked: “And where is the Savior?” when
the two rich rogues showed him their portraits.
In one case the tendency serves to answer one
insult with another; in the other case it offers
an affront instead of the demanded expert
opinion; in both cases the tendency was opposed
by purely external factors, namely, the
powerful position of the persons who are the
targets of the insult. Nevertheless it may seem
strange to us that these and analogous tendency-witticisms
have not the power to produce
a strong laughing effect, no matter how much
they may gratify us.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is different, however, if no external factors
but internal hindrances stand in the way
of the direct realization of the tendency, that
is, if an inner feeling opposes the tendency.
This condition, according to our assumption,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>was present in the aggressive joke of Mr. N.
(p. 28) and in the one of Wendell Phillips, in
whom a strong inclination to use invectives was
stifled by a highly developed æsthetic sense.
With the aid of wit the inner resistances in
these special cases were overcome and the inhibition
removed. As in the case of external
hindrances, the gratification of the tendency is
made possible, and a suppression with its concomitant
“psychic damming” is thus obviated.
So far the mechanism of the development of
pleasure would seem to be identical in both
cases.</p>

<p class='c008'>At this place, however, we are inclined to
feel that we should enter more deeply into the
differentiation of the psychological situation between
the cases of external and internal hindrance,
as we have a faint notion that the removal
of the inner hindrance might possibly
result in a disproportionately higher contribution
to pleasure. But I propose that we rest
content here, that we be satisfied for the present
with this one collection of evidence which
adheres to what is essential to us. The only
difference between the cases of outer and inner
hindrances consists in the fact that here an already
existing inhibition is removed, while
there the formation of a new inhibition is
avoided. We hardly resort to speculation when
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>we assert that a “<em>psychic expenditure</em>” is required
for the formation as well as for the retention
of a psychic inhibition. Now if we find
that in both cases the use of the tendency-wit
produces pleasure, then it may be assumed
<em>that such resultant pleasure corresponds to the
economy of psychic expenditure</em>.</p>

<p class='c008'>Thus we are once more confronted with the
principle of <em>economy</em> which we noticed first in
the study of the technique of word-wit. But
whereas the economy we believed to have found
at first was in the use of few or possibly the
same words, we can here foresee an economy
of psychic expenditure in general in a far more
comprehensive sense, and we think it possible
to come nearer to the nature of wit through
a better determination of the as yet very obscure
idea of “psychic expenditure.”</p>

<p class='c008'>A certain amount of haziness which we could
not dissipate during the study of the pleasure
mechanism in tendency-wit we accept as a
slight punishment for attempting to elucidate
more complicated problem before the simpler
one, or the tendency-wit before the harmless
wit. We observe that “<em>economy in the expenditure
of inhibitions or suppressions</em>” seems
to be the secret of the pleasurable effect of
tendency-wit, and we now turn to the mechanism
of the pleasure in harmless wit.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>While examining appropriate examples of
harmless witticisms, in which we had no fear
of false judgment through content or tendency,
we were forced to the conclusion that the
techniques of with themselves are pleasure-sources;
now we wish to ascertain whether the
pleasure may be traced to the economy in
psychic expenditure. In a group of these witticisms
(plays on words) the technique consisted
in directing the psychic focus upon the
sound instead of upon the sense of the word,
and in allowing the (acoustic) word-disguise
to take the place of the meaning accorded to it
by its relations to reality. We are really justified
in assuming that great relief is thereby afforded
to the psychic work, and that in the
serious use of words we refrain from this convenient
procedure only at the expense of a
certain amount of exertion. We can observe
that abnormal mental states, in which the possibility
of concentrating psychic expenditure on
one place is probably restricted, actually allow
to come to the foreground word-sound associations
of this kind rather than the significance of
the words, and that such patients react in their
speech with “outer” instead of “inner” associations.
Also in children who are still accustomed
to treat the word as an object we
notice the inclination to look for the same
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>meaning in words of the same or of similar
sounds, which is a source of great amusement
to adults. If we experience in wit an unmistakable
pleasure because through the use of the
same or similar words we reach from one set
of ideas to a distant other one, (as in “Home-Roulard”
from the kitchen to politics), we can
justly refer this pleasure to the economy of
psychic expenditure. The pleasure of the wit
resulting from such a “short-circuit” appears
greater the more remote and foreign the two
series of ideas which become related through
the same word are to each other, or the greater
the economy in thought brought about by the
technical means of wit. We may add that in
this case wit makes use of a means of connection
which is rejected by and carefully avoided
in serious thinking.<a id='r45'></a><a href='#f45' class='c007'><sup>[45]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>A second group of technical means of wit—unification,
similar sounding words, manifold
application, modification of familiar idioms, allusions
to quotations—all evince one common
character, namely, that one always discovers
something familiar where one expects to find
something new instead. To discover the familiar
is pleasurable and it is not difficult to
recognize such pleasure as economy-pleasure
and to refer it to the economy of psychic expenditure.</p>

<p class='c008'>That the discovery of the familiar—“recognition”—causes
pleasure seems to be universally
admitted. Groos says:<a id='r46'></a><a href='#f46' class='c007'><sup>[46]</sup></a> “Recognition
is everywhere bound up with feelings of pleasure
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>where it has not been made too mechanical,
(as perhaps in dressing...). Even the mere
quality of acquaintanceship is easily accompanied
by that gentle delight which Faust experiences
when, after an uncanny experience, he
steps into his study.” If the act of recognition
is so pleasureful, we may expect that man
merges into the habit of practicing this activity
for its own sake, that is, he experiments
playfully with it. In fact, Aristotle recognized
in the joy of rediscovery the basis of artistic
pleasure, and it cannot be denied that this
principle must not be overlooked even if it has
not such a far-reaching significance as Aristotle
assumes.</p>

<p class='c008'>Groos then discusses the games, whose character
consists of heightening the pleasure of
rediscovery by putting hindrances in its path,
or in other words by raising a “psychic dam”
which is removed by the act of recognition.
However, his attempted explanation leaves the
assumption that recognition as such is pleasurable,
in that he attributes the pleasure of recognition
connected with these games to the
pleasure in power or to the surmounting of a
difficulty. I consider this latter factor as secondary,
and I find no occasion for abandoning
the simpler explanation, that the recognition
<em>per se</em>, i.e., through the alleviation of the psychic
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>expenditure, is pleasurable, and that the
games founded upon this pleasure make use
of the damming-mechanism merely in order to
intensify their effect.</p>

<p class='c008'>We know also that the source of pleasure in
rhyme, alliteration, refrain, and other forms of
repetition of similar sounding words in poetry,
is due merely to the discovery of the familiar.
A “sense of power” plays no perceptible rôle
in these techniques, which show so marked an
agreement with the “manifold application” in
wit.</p>

<p class='c008'>Considering the close connection between recognition
and remembering, the assumption is
no longer daring that there exists also a pleasure
in remembering, i.e., that the act of remembering
in itself is accompanied by a feeling of
pleasure of a similar origin. Groos seems to
have no objection to such an assumption, but
he again deducts the pleasure of remembering
from the “sense of power” in which he seeks—as
I believe unjustly—the principal basis of
pleasure in almost all games.</p>

<h4 class='c016'><em>The Factor of Actuality</em></h4>

<p class='c017'>The use of another technical expedient of
wit, which has not yet been mentioned, is also
dependent upon “the rediscovery of the familiar.”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>I refer to the factor of <em>actuality</em>
(dealing with actual persons, things, or events),
which in many witticisms provides a prolific
source of pleasure and explains several peculiarities
in the life history of wit. There are
witticisms which are entirely free from this condition,
and in a treatise on wit it is incumbent
upon us to make use of such examples almost
exclusively. But we must not forget that we
laughed perhaps more heartily over such perennial
witticisms than over others; witticisms
whose application now would be difficult, because
they would require long commentaries,
and even with that aid the former effect could
not be attained. These latter witticisms contained
allusions to persons and occurrences
which were “actual” at the time, which had
stimulated general interest and were endowed
with tension. After the cessation of this
interest, after the settlement of these particular
affairs, the witticisms lost a part of
their pleasurable effect, and a very considerable.
Thus, for example, the joke which
my friendly host made when he called
the dish that was being served a “Home-Roulard,”
seems to me by no means as good
now as when the question of Home Rule was
a continuous headline in the political columns
of our newspaper. If I now attempt to express
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>my appreciation of this joke by stating
that this one word led us from the idea of the
kitchen to the distant field of politics, and
saved us a long mental detour, I should have
been forced at that time to change this description
as follows: “That this word led us from
the idea of the kitchen to the very distant field
of politics; but that our lively interest was all
the keener because this question was constantly
absorbing us.” The same thing is true of
another joke: “<em>This girl reminds me of
Dreyfus; the army does not believe in her innocence</em>,”
which has become blurred in spite of
the fact that its technical means has remained
unchanged. The confusion arising from the
comparison with, and the double meaning of,
the word “innocence” cannot do away with the
fact that the allusion, which at that time
touched upon a matter pregnant with excitement,
now recalls an interest set at rest. The
many irresistible jokes about the present war
will sink in our estimation in a very short time.</p>

<p class='c008'>A great many witticisms in circulation reach
a certain age or rather go through a course
composed of a flourishing season and a mature
season, and then sink into complete oblivion.
The need that people feel to draw pleasure
from their mental processes continually creates
new witticisms which are supported by current
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>interests of the day. The vitality of actual witticisms
is not their own, it is borrowed by way
of allusion from those other interests, the expiration
of which determines the fate of the
witticism. The factor of actuality which may
be added as a transitory pleasure-source of wit,
although it is productive in itself, cannot be
simply put on the same basis as the rediscovery
of the familiar. It is much more a question of
a special qualification of the familiar which
must be aided by the quality of freshness and
recency and which has not been affected by forgetfulness.
In the formation of the dream one
also finds that there is a special preference for
what is recent, and one cannot refrain from inferring
that the association with what is recent
is rewarded or facilitated by a special pleasure
premium.</p>

<p class='c008'>Unification, which is really nothing more
than repetition in the sphere of mental association
instead of in material, has been accorded
an especial recognition as a pleasure-source
of wit by G. Th. Fechner.<a id='r47'></a><a href='#f47' class='c007'><sup>[47]</sup></a> He says:
“In my opinion the principle of uniform connection
of the manifold, plays the most important
rôle in the field under discussion; it
needs, however, the support of subsidiary determinations
in order to drive across the threshold
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>the pleasure with its peculiar character
which the cases here belonging can furnish.”<a id='r48'></a><a href='#f48' class='c007'><sup>[48]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>In all of these cases of repetition of the same
association or of the same word-material, of refinding
the familiar and recent, we surely cannot
be prevented from referring the pleasure
thereby experienced to the economy in psychic
expenditure; providing that this viewpoint
proves fertile for the explanation of single
facts as well as for bringing to light new generalities.
We are fully conscious of the fact
that we have yet to make clear the manner in
which this economy results and also the meaning
of the expression “psychic expenditure.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The third group of the technique of wit,
mostly thought-wit, which includes false logic,
displacement, absurdity, representation through
the opposite, and other varieties, may seem at
first sight to present special features and to be
unrelated to the techniques of the discovery
of the familiar, or the replacing of object-associations
by word-associations. But it will not
be difficult to demonstrate that this group, too,
shows an economy or facilitation of psychic
expenditure.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is quite obvious that it is easier and more
convenient to turn away from a definite trend
of thought than to stick to it; it is easier to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>mix up different things than to distinguish
them; and it is particularly easier to travel
over modes of reasoning unsanctioned by logic;
finally in connecting words or thoughts it is
especially easy to overlook the fact that such
connections should result in sense. All this is
indubitable and this is exactly what is done by
the techniques of the wit in question. It will
sound strange, however, to assert that such
processes in the wit-work may produce pleasure,
since outside of wit we can experience only
unpleasant feelings of defense against all these
kinds of inferior achievement of our mental activity.</p>

<h4 class='c016'><em>Word-pleasure and Pleasure in Nonsense</em></h4>

<p class='c017'>The “pleasure in nonsense,” as we may call
it for short, is, in the seriousness of our life,
crowded back almost to the vanishing point.
To demonstrate it we must enter into the study
of two cases in one of which it is still visible
and in the other becomes visible for the second
time. I refer to the behavior of the learning
child and to the behavior of the adult under unstable
toxic influences. When the child learns
to control the vocabulary of its mother tongue
it apparently takes great pleasure in “experimenting
playfully” with that material
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>(Groos); it connects words without regard for
their meaning in order to obtain pleasure from
the rhyme and rhythm. Gradually the child
is deprived of this pleasure until only the senseful
connection of words is allowed him. But
even in later life there is still a tendency to
overstep the acquired restrictions in the use of
words, a tendency which manifests itself in
disfiguring the same by definite appendages,
and in changing their forms by means of certain
contrivances (reduplication, trembling
speech) or even by developing an individual
language for use in playing,—efforts which reappear
also among the insane of a certain category.</p>

<p class='c008'>I believe that whatever the motive which
actuated the child when it began such playings,
in its further development the child indulges in
them fully conscious that they are nonsensical
and derives pleasure from this stimulus which
is interdicted by reason. It now makes use
of play in order to withdraw from the pressure
of critical reason. More powerful, however,
are the restrictions which must develop in education
along the lines of right thinking and in
the separation of reality from fiction, and it is
for this reason that the resistance against the
pressures of thinking and reality is far-reaching
and persistent; even the phenomena of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>phantasy formation come under this point of
view. The power of reason usually grows so
strong during the later part of childhood and
during that period of education which extends
over the age of puberty, that the pleasure in
“freed nonsense” rarely dares manifest itself.
One fears to utter nonsense; but it seems to
me that the inclination characteristic of boys
to act in a contradictory and inexpedient manner
is a direct outcome of this pleasure in nonsense.
In pathological cases one often sees
this tendency so accentuated that it again controls
the speeches and answers of the pupils.
In the case of some college students who
merged into neuroses I could convince myself
that the unconscious pleasure derived from the
nonsense produced by them is just as much
responsible for their mistakes as their actual
ignorance.</p>

<h4 class='c016'><em>Reproduction of Old Liberties</em></h4>

<p class='c017'>The student does not give up his demonstrations
against the pressures of thinking and
reality whose domination becomes unceasingly
intolerant and unrestricted. A good part of
the tendency of students to skylarking is responsible
for this reaction. Man is an “untiring
pleasure seeker”—I can no longer recall
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>which author coined this happy expression—and
finds it extremely difficult to renounce
pleasure once experienced. With the hilarious
nonsense of “sprees” (<i><span lang="de">Bierschwefel</span></i>), college
cries, and songs, the student attempts to preserve
that pleasure which results from freedom
of thought, a freedom of which he is more and
more deprived through scholastic discipline.
Even much later, when as a mature man he
meets with others at scientific congresses and
class reunions and feels himself a student
again, he must read at the end of the session
the “<i><span lang="de">Kneipzeitung</span></i>,” or the comic college paper,
which distorts the newly gained knowledge into
the nonsensical and thus compensates him for the
newly added mental inhibitions.</p>

<p class='c008'>The very terms “<i><span lang="de">Bierschwefel</span></i>” and “<i><span lang="de">Kneipzeitung</span></i>”
are proof that the reason which has
stifled the pleasure in nonsense has become so
powerful that not even temporarily can it be
abandoned without toxic agency. The change
in the state of mind is the most valuable thing
that alcohol offers man, and that is the reason
why this “poison” is not equally indispensable
for all people. The hilarious humor, whether
due to endogenous origin or whether produced
toxically, weakens the inhibiting forces among
which is reason and thus again makes accessible
pleasure-sources which are burdened by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>suppression. It is very instructive to see how
the demand made upon wit sinks with the rise
in spirits. The latter actually replace wit, just
as wit must make an effort to replace the mental
state in which the otherwise inhibited pleasure
possibilities (pleasure in nonsense among
the rest) assert themselves.</p>

<p class='c008'>“With little wit and much comfort.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Under the influence of alcohol the adult
again becomes a child who derives pleasure
from the free disposal of his mental stream
without being restricted by the pressure of
logic.</p>

<p class='c008'>We hope we have shown that the technique
of absurdity in wit corresponds to a source of
pleasure. We need hardly repeat that this
pleasure results from the economy of psychic
expenditure or alleviation from the pressure
of reason.</p>

<p class='c008'>On reviewing again the wit-technique classified
under three headings we notice that the
first and last of these groups—the replacement
of object-association by word-association, and
the use of absurdity as a restorer of old liberties
and as a relief from the pressure of
intellectual upbringing—can be taken collectively.
Psychic relief may in a way be compared
to economy, which constitutes the technique
of the second group. Alleviation of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>already existing psychic expenditure, and economy
in the yet to be offered psychic expenditure,
are two principles from which all techniques
of wit and with them all pleasure in
these techniques can be deduced. The two
forms of the technique and the resultant pleasures
correspond more or less in general to the
division of wit into word- and thought-witticisms.</p>

<h4 class='c016'><em>Play and Jest</em></h4>

<p class='c017'>The preceding discussions have led us unexpectedly
to an understanding of the history of
the development of psychogenesis of wit which
we shall now examine still further. We have
become acquainted with the successive steps in
wit, the development of which up to tendency-wit
will undoubtedly reveal new relationships
between the different characters of wit. Antedating
wit there exists something which we
may designate as “play” or “jest.” Play—we
shall retain this name—appears in children
while they are learning how to use words and
connect thoughts; this playing is probably the
result of an impulse which urges the child to
exercise its capacities (Groos). During this
process it experiences pleasurable effects which
originate from the repetition of similarities,
the rediscovery of the familiar, sound-associations,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>etc., which may be explained as an unexpected
economy of psychic expenditure.
Therefore it surprises no one that these resulting
pleasures urge the child to practice playing
and impel it to continue without regard
for the meaning of words or the connections
between sentences. Playing with words and
thoughts, motivated by certain pleasures in
economy, would thus be the first step of wit.</p>

<p class='c008'>This playing is stopped by the growing
strength of a factor which may well be called
criticism or reason. The play is then rejected
as senseless or as directly absurd, and by virtue
of reason it becomes impossible. Only accidentally
is it now possible to derive pleasure
from those sources of rediscovery of the familiar,
etc., which is explained by the fact that
the maturing person has then merged into a
playful mood which, as in the case of merriment
in the child, removes inhibitions. In this
way only is the old pleasure-giving playing
made possible, but as men do not wish to wait
for these propitious occasions and also hate to
forego this pleasure, they seek means to make
themselves independent of these pleasant states.
The further development of wit is directed by
these two impulses; the one striving to elude
reason and the other to substitute for the adult
an infantile state of mind.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>This gives rise to the second stage of wit, the
<em>jest</em> (<i><span lang="de">Scherz</span></i>). The object of the jest is to
bring about the resultant pleasure of playing
and at the same time appease the protesting
reason which strives to suppress the pleasant
feeling. There is but one way to accomplish this.
The senseless combination of words or
the absurd linking of thoughts must make sense
after all. The whole process of wit production
is therefore directed towards the discovery of
words and thought constellations which fulfill
these conditions. The jest makes use of almost
all the technical means of wit, and usage of
language makes no consequential distinction
between jest (<i><span lang="de">Scherz</span></i>) and wit (<i><span lang="de">Witz</span></i>). What
distinguishes the jest from wit is the fact that
the pith of the sentence withdrawn from criticism
does not need to be valuable, new, or even
good; it matters only that it can be expressed,
even though what it may say is obsolete, superfluous,
and useless. The most conspicuous factor
of the jest is the gratification it affords by
making possible that which reason forbids.</p>

<p class='c008'>A mere jest is the following of Professor
Kästner, who taught physics at Göttingen in
the 16th century, and who was fond of making
jokes. Wishing to enroll a student named
Warr in his class, he asked him his age, and
upon receiving the reply that he was thirty
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>years of age he exclaimed: “Aha, so I have
the honor of seeing the thirty years’ War.”<a id='r49'></a><a href='#f49' class='c007'><sup>[49]</sup></a>
When asked what vocations his sons followed
Rokitansky jestingly answered: “Two are healing
and two are howling,” (two physicians and
two singers). The reply was correct and therefore
unimpeachable, but it added nothing to
what is contained in the parenthetic expression.
There is no doubt that the answer assumed
another form only because of the pleasure
which arises from the unification and assonance
of both words.</p>

<p class='c008'>I believe that we now see our way clear. In
estimating the techniques of wit we were constantly
disturbed by the fact that these are not
peculiar to wit alone, and yet the nature of wit
seemed to depend upon them, since their removal
by means of reduction nullified the character
as well as the pleasure of wit. Now we
become aware that what we have described as
techniques of wit—and which in a certain sense
we shall have to continue to call so—are really
the sources from which wit derives pleasure;
nor does it strike us as strange that other
processes draw from the same sources with the
same object in view. The technique, however,
which is peculiar to and belongs to wit alone
consists in a process of safeguarding the use
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>of this pleasure-forming means against the
protest of reason which would obviate the pleasure.
We can make few generalizations about
this process. The wit-work, as we have already
remarked, expresses itself in the selection of
such word-material and such thought-situations
as to permit the old play with words and
thoughts to stand the test of reason; but to accomplish
this end the cleverest use must be
made of all the peculiarities of the stock of
words and of all constellations of mental combinations.
Later on perhaps we shall be in a
position to characterize the wit-work by a
definite attribute; for the present it must remain
unexplained how our wit makes its advantageous
selections. The tendency and capacity
of wit to guard the pleasure-forming
word and thought combinations against reason,
already makes itself visible as an essential criterion
in jests. From the beginning its object
is to remove inner inhibitions and thereby render
productive those pleasure-sources which have
become inaccessible, and we shall find that it
remains true to this characteristic throughout
the course of its entire development.</p>

<p class='c008'>We are now in a position to prescribe a correct
place for the factor “sense in nonsense,”
(see Introduction, page 8), to which the authors
ascribe so much significance in respect to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>recognition of wit and the explanation of the
pleasurable effect. The two firmly established
points in the determination of wit—its tendency
to carry through the pleasureful play, and its
effort to guard it against the criticism of reason—make
it perfectly clear why the individual
witticism, even though it appear nonsensical
from one point of view, must appear full of
meaning or at least acceptable from another.
How it accomplishes this is the business of the
wit-work; if it is not successful it is relegated
to the category of “nonsense.” Nor do we find
it necessary to deduce the resultant pleasure
of wit from the conflict of feelings which
emerge either directly or by way of “confusion
and clearness,” from the simultaneous
sense and nonsense of the wit. There is just
as little necessity for our delving deeper into
the question how pleasure can come from the
succession of that part of the wit considered
senseless and from that part recognized as
senseful. The psychogenesis of wit has taught
us that the pleasure of wit arises from word-play
or from the liberation of nonsense, and
that the sense of wit is meant only to
guard this pleasure against suppression through
reason.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>
  <h4 class='c016'><em>Jest and Wit</em></h4>
</div>

<p class='c017'>Thus the problem of the essential character
of wit could almost be explained by means of
the jest. We may follow the development of
the jest until it reaches its height in the tendency-wit.
The jest gives tendency a prior
position when it is a question of supplying us
with pleasure, and it is content when its utterance
does not appear utterly senseless or insipid.
But if this utterance is substantial and
valuable the jest changes into wit. A thought,
which would have been worthy of our interest
even when expressed in the most unpretentious
form, is now invested in a form which must in
itself excite our sense of satisfaction. Such
an association we cannot help thinking certainly
has not come into existence unintentionally;
we must make effort to divine the intention
at the bottom of the formation of wit.
An incidental observation, made once before,
will put us on the right track. We have already
remarked that a good witticism gives
us, so to speak, a general feeling of satisfaction
without our being able to decide offhand
which part of the pleasure comes from the
witty form and which part from the excellent
thought contained in the context (p. 131). We
are deceiving ourselves constantly about this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>division; sometimes we overvalue the quality of
the wit on account of our admiration for the
thought contained therein, and then again we
overestimate the value of the thought on account
of the pleasure afforded us by the witty
investment. We know not what gives us pleasure
nor at what we are laughing. This uncertainty
of our judgment, assuming it to be
a fact, may have given the motive for the
formation of wit in the literal sense. The
thought seeks the witty disguise because it
thereby recommends itself to our attention and
can thus appear to us more important and valuable
than it really is; but above all because
this disguise fascinates and confuses our reason.
We are apt to attribute to the thought
the pleasure derived from the witty form, and
we are not inclined to consider improper what
has given us pleasure, and in this way deprive
ourselves of a source of pleasure. For if wit
made us laugh it was because it established in
us a mood most unfavorable to reason, which
in turn has forced upon us that state of mind
which was once contented with mere playing
and which wit has attempted to replace with
all the means at its command. Although we
have already established the fact that such wit
is harmless and does not yet show a tendency,
we may not deny that, strictly speaking, it is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>the jest alone which shows no tendency; that
is, it serves to produce pleasure only. For wit
is really never purposeless even if the thought
contained therein shows no tendency and
merely serves a theoretical, intellectual interest.
Wit carries out its purpose in advancing the
thought by magnifying it and by guarding it
against reason. Here again it reveals its original
nature in that it sets itself up against an
inhibiting and restrictive power, or against the
critical judgment.</p>

<p class='c008'>The first use of wit, which goes beyond the
mere production of pleasure, points out the
road to be followed. Wit is now recognized
as a powerful psychic factor whose weight can
decide the issue if it falls into this or that side
of the scale. The great tendencies and impulses
of our psychic life enlist its service for
their own purposes. The original purposeless
wit, which began as play, becomes related in a
<em>secondary</em> manner to tendencies from which
nothing that is formed in psychic life can
escape for any length of time. We already
know what it can achieve in the service of the
exhibitionistic, aggressive, cynical, and sceptical
tendencies. In the case of obscene wit,
which originated in the smutty joke, it makes
a confederate of the third person who originally
disturbed the sexual situation, by giving
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>him pleasure through the utterance which
causes the woman to be ashamed in his presence.
In the case of the aggressive tendency,
wit by the same means changes the original indifferent
hearers into active haters and scorners,
and in this way confronts the enemy with
a host of opponents where formerly there was
but one. In the first case it overcomes the inhibitions
of shame and decorum by the pleasure
premium which it offers. In the second
case it overthrows the critical judgment which
would otherwise have examined the dispute in
question. In the third and fourth cases where
wit is in the service of the cynical and sceptical
tendency, it shatters the respect for institutions
and truths in which the hearer had believed,
first by strengthening the argument,
and secondly by resorting to a new method of
attack. Where the argument seeks to draw
the hearer’s reason to its side, wit strives to
push aside this reason. There is no doubt that
wit has chosen the way which is psychologically
more efficacious.</p>

<h4 class='c016'><em>The Development into Tendency-wit</em></h4>

<p class='c017'>What impressed us in reviewing the achievements
of tendency-wit was the effect it produced
on the hearer. It is more important,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>however, to understand the effect produced by
wit on the psychic life of the person who makes
it, or more precisely expressed, on the psychic
life of the person who conceives it. Once before
we have expressed the intention, which we
find occasion to repeat here, that we wish to
study the psychic processes of wit in regard
to its apportionment between two persons.
We can assume for the present that the psychic
process aroused by wit in the hearer is usually
an imitation of the psychic processes of the wit
producer. The outer inhibitions which are to
be overcome in the hearer correspond to the
inner inhibitions of the wit producer. In the
latter the expectation of the outer hindrance
exists, at least as an inhibiting idea. The inner
hindrance, which is overcome in tendency-wit,
is evident in some single cases; for example, in
Mr. N.’s joke (p. 28) we can assume that it
not only enables the hearer to enjoy the pleasure
of the aggression through injuries but it
also makes it possible for him to produce the
wit in the first place. Of the different kinds
of inner inhibitions or suppressions one is
especially worthy of our interest because it is
the most far-reaching. We designate that
form by the term “repression.” It is characterized
by the fact that it excludes from consciousness
certain former emotions and their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>products. We shall learn that tendency-wit
itself is capable of liberating pleasure from
sources that have undergone repression. If the
overcoming of outer hindrances can be referred,
in the manner indicated above, to inner
inhibitions and repressions we may say that
tendency-wit proves more clearly than any
other developmental stage of wit that the main
character of wit-making is to set free pleasure
by removing inhibitions. It reinforces tendencies
to which it gives its services by bringing them
assistance from repressed emotions; or it puts
itself at the disposal of the repressed tendencies
directly.</p>

<p class='c008'>One may readily concede that these are the
functions of tendency-wit, but one must nevertheless
admit that we do not understand in
what manner these functions can succeed in
accomplishing their end. The power of tendency-wit
consists in the pleasure which it derives
from the sources of word-plays and liberated
nonsense, and if one can judge from
the impressions received from purposeless jests,
one cannot possibly consider the amount of the
pleasure so great as to believe that it has the
power to annul deep-rooted inhibitions and repressions.
As a matter of fact we do not deal
here with a simple propelling power but rather
with a more complicated mechanism. Instead
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>of covering the long circuitous route through
which I arrived at an understanding of this relationship,
I shall endeavor to demonstrate it by
a short synthetic route.</p>

<p class='c008'>G. Th. Fechner has established the principle
of æsthetic assistance or enhancement which he
explains in the following words: “<em>From the
unopposed meeting of pleasurable states (Bedingungen)
which individually accomplish little,
there results a greater, often much greater
resultant pleasure than is warranted by the
sum of the pleasure values of the separate
states, or a greater result than could be accounted
for as the sum of the individual effects;
in fact the mere meeting of this kind can
result in a positive pleasure product which
overflows the threshold of pleasure when the
factors taken separately are too weak to accomplish
this. The only condition is that in
comparison to others they must produce a
greater sense of satisfaction.</em>”<a id='r50'></a><a href='#f50' class='c007'><sup>[50]</sup></a> I am of the
opinion that the theme of wit does not give us
the opportunity to test the correctness of this
principle which is demonstrable in many other
artistic fields. But from wit we have learned
something, which at least comes near this principle,
namely, that in a co-operation of many
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>pleasure-producing factors we are in no position
to assign to each one the resultant part
which really belongs to it (see p. 131). But the
situation assumed in the principle of assistance
can be varied, and for these new conditions we
can formulate the following combination of
questions which are worthy of a reply. What
usually happens if in one constellation there is
a meeting of pleasurable and painful conditions?
Upon what depends the result and the
previous intimations of the result? Tendency-wit
particularly shows these possibilities.
There is one feeling or impulse which strives
to liberate pleasure from a certain source and
under unrestricted conditions certainly would
liberate it, but there is another impulse which
works against this development of pleasure,
that is, which inhibits or suppresses it. The
suppressing stream, as the result shows, must
be somewhat stronger than the one suppressed,
which however is by no means destroyed.</p>

<h4 class='c016'><em>The Fore-pleasure Principle</em></h4>

<p class='c017'>But now there appears another impulse
which strives to set free pleasure by this identical
process, even though from different sources
it thus acts like the suppressed stream. What
can be the result in such a case? An example
can make this clearer than this schematization.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>There is an impulse to insult a certain person;
but this is so strongly opposed by a feeling
of decorum and æsthetic culture that the impulse
to insult must be crushed. If, for example,
by virtue of some changed emotional state
the insult should happen to break through, this
insulting tendency would subsequently be painfully
perceived. Therefore the insult is omitted.
There is a possibility, however, of making
good wit from the words or thoughts which
would have served in the insult; that is, pleasure
can be set free from other sources without
being hindered by the same suppression. But
the second development of pleasure would have
to be foregone if the insulting quality of the
wit were not allowed to come out, and as the
latter is allowed to come to the surface, it is
connected with the new release of pleasure.
Experience with tendency-wit shows that under
such circumstances the suppressed tendency
can become so strengthened by the aid of wit-pleasure
as to overcome the otherwise stronger
inhibition. One resorts to insults because wit
is thereby made impossible. But the satisfaction
thus obtained is not produced by wit
alone; it is incomparably greater, in fact it is
by so much greater than the pleasure of the
wit, that we must assume that the former suppressed
tendency has succeeded in breaking
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>through, perhaps without the need of an outlet.
Under these circumstances tendency-wit
causes the most prolific laughter.</p>

<p class='c008'>Perhaps the investigation of the determinations
of laughter will aid us in forming a
clearer picture of the process of the aid of wit
against suppression. But we see even now
that the case of tendency-wit is a special case
of the principle of aid. A possibility of the
development of pleasure enters into a situation
in which another pleasure possibility is so
hindered that individually it would not result
in pleasure. The result is a development of
pleasure which is greater by far than the added
possibility. The latter acted, as it were, as an
<em>alluring premium</em>; with the aid of a small sum
of pleasure a very large and almost inaccessible
amount is obtained. I have good grounds
for thinking that this principle corresponds to
an arrangement which holds true in many
widely separated spheres of the psychic life,
and I consider it appropriate to designate the
pleasure serving to liberate the large sum of
pleasure as <em>fore-pleasure</em> and the principle as
the <em>principle of fore-pleasure</em>.</p>

<h4 class='c016'><em>Play-pleasure and Removal-pleasure</em></h4>

<p class='c017'>The effect of tendency-wit may now be
formulated as follows: It enters the service of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>tendencies in order to produce new pleasure by
removing suppressions and repressions. This it
does, using wit-pleasure as fore-pleasure.
When we now review its development we may
say that wit has remained true to its nature
from beginning to end. It begins as play in
order to obtain pleasure from the free use of
words and thoughts. As soon as the growing
reason forbids this senseless play with words
and thoughts, it turns to the jest or joke in
order to hold to these sources of pleasure and
in order to be able to gain new pleasure from
the liberation of the absurd. In the rôle of
harmless wit it assists the thoughts and fortifies
them against the impugnment of the critical
judgment, whereby it makes use of the
principle of intermingling the pleasure-sources.
Finally, it enters into the great struggling
suppressed tendencies in order to remove inner
inhibitions in accordance with the principle of
fore-pleasure. Reason, critical judgment, and
suppression, these are the forces which it combats
in turn. It firmly holds on to the original
word-pleasure-sources, and beginning with the
stage of the jest opens for itself new pleasure-sources
by removing inhibition. The pleasure
which it produces, be it play-pleasure or removal-pleasure,
can at all times be traced to
the economy of psychic expenditure, in so far
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>as such a conception does not contradict the
nature of pleasure, and proves itself productive
also in other fields.<a id='r51'></a><a href='#f51' class='c007'><sup>[51]</sup></a></p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>
  <h3 class='c001'>V<br> <span class='c015'>THE MOTIVES OF WIT AND WIT AS A SOCIAL PROCESS</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c006'>It seems superfluous to speak of the motives
of wit, since the purpose of obtaining pleasure
must be recognized as a sufficient motive of the
wit-work. But on the one hand it is not impossible
that still other motives participate in
the production of wit, and on the other hand,
in view of certain well-known experiences, the
theme of the subjective determination of wit
must be discussed.</p>

<p class='c008'>Two things above all urge us to it. Though
wit-making is an excellent means of obtaining
pleasure from the psychic processes, we know
that not all persons are equally able to make
use of it. Wit-making is not at the disposal
of all, in general there are but a few persons
to whom one can point and say that they are
witty. Here wit seems to be a special ability
somewhere within the region of the old “psychic
faculties,” and this shows itself in its appearance
as fairly independent of the other
faculties such as intelligence, phantasy, memory,
etc. A special talent or psychic determination
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>permitting or favoring wit-making
must be presupposed in all wit-makers.</p>

<p class='c008'>I am afraid that we shall not get very far
in the exploration of this theme. Only now
and then do we succeed in proceeding from
the understanding of a single witticism to the
knowledge of the subjective determinations in
the mind of the wit-maker. It is quite accidental
that the example of wit with which we
began our investigation of the wit-technique
permits us also to gain some insight into the
subjective determination of the witticism. I
am referring to Heine’s witticism, to which also
Heymans and Lipps have paid attention.</p>

<p class='c008'>“<em>I was sitting next to Solomon Rothschild
and he treated me just as an equal, quite famillionaire</em>”
(“Bäder von Lucca”).</p>

<h4 class='c016'><em>Subjective Determination of the “Famillionaire” Witticism</em></h4>

<p class='c017'>Heine put this word in the mouth of a comical
person, Hirsch-Hyacinth, collector, operator
and tax appraiser from Hamburg, and
valet of the aristocratic baron, Cristoforo Gumpelino
(formerly Gumpel). Evidently the
poet has experienced great pleasure in these
productions, for he allows Hirsch-Hyacinth to
talk big and puts in his mouth the most amusing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>and most candid utterances; he positively
endows him with the practical wisdom of a
Sancho Panza. It is a pity that Heine, as it
seems, had no liking for this dramatic figure
and that he drops the delightful character so
soon. From many passages it would seem that
the poet himself is speaking behind the transparent
mask of Hirsch-Hyacinth, and we are
quite convinced that this person is nothing but
a parody of the poet himself. Hirsch tells of
reasons why he has discarded his former name
and now calls himself Hyacinth. “Besides I
have the advantage,” he continues, “of having
an H on my seal already, and therefore I am
in no need of having a new letter engraved.”
But Heine himself resorted to this economy
when he changed his surname “Harry” to
“Heinrich” at his baptism. Every one acquainted
with the life of the poet will recall
that in Hamburg, where one also meets the
personage Hirsch-Hyacinth, Heine had an uncle
of the same name, who played the greatest
rôle in Heine’s life as the wealthy member of
the family. The uncle’s name was likewise Solomon,
just like the elderly Rothschild who
treated the impecunious Hirsch on such a famillionaire
basis. What seems to be merely
a jest in the mouth of Hirsch-Hyacinth soon
reveals a background of earnest bitterness
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>when we attribute it to the nephew Harry-Heinrich.
For he belonged to the family, nay,
more, it was his earnest wish to marry a
daughter of this uncle, but she refused him,
and his uncle always treated him on a somewhat
famillionaire basis, as a poor relative.
His rich relatives in Hamburg always dealt
with him condescendingly. I recall the story
of one of his old aunts by marriage who, when
she was still young and pretty, sat next to some
one at a family dinner who seemed to her unprepossessing
and whom the other members
of the family treated shabbily. She did not
feel herself called upon to be any more condescending
towards him. Only many years
later did she discover that the careless and
neglected cousin was the poet Heinrich Heine.
We know from many a record how keenly
Heine suffered from these repulses at the
hands of his wealthy relatives in his youth and
during later years. The witticism “famillionaire”
grew out of the soil of such a subjective
emotional feeling.</p>

<p class='c008'>One may suspect similar subjective determinations
in many other witticisms of the great
scoffers, but I know of no other example by
which one can show this in such a convincing
way. It is therefore hazardous to venture a
more definite opinion about the nature of this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>personal determination. Furthermore, one is
not inclined in the first place to claim similar
complicated conditions for the origin of each
and every witticism. Neither are the witty
productions of other celebrated men better
suited to give us the desired insight into the
subjective determination of wit. In fact, one
gets the impression that the subjective determination
of wit production is oftentimes not
unrelated to persons suffering from neurotic
diseases, when, for example, one learns that
Lichtenberg was a confirmed hypochondriac
burdened with all kinds of eccentricities. The
great majority of witticisms, especially those
produced from current happenings, are anonymous;
one might be inquisitive to know what
kind of people they are who originate them.
The physician occasionally has an opportunity
to make a study of persons who, if not renowned
wits, are recognized in their circle as
witty and as originators of many passable witticisms;
he is often surprised to find such persons
showing dissociated personalities and a
predisposition to nervous affections. However,
owing to insufficient data, we certainly cannot
maintain that such a psychoneurotic constitution
is a regular or necessary subjective condition
for wit-making.</p>

<p class='c008'>A clearer case is afforded by Jewish witticisms
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>which, as before mentioned, are made exclusively
by Jews themselves, whereas Jewish
stories of different origin rarely rise above the
level of the comical strain or of brutal mockery
(p. 166). The determination for the self-participation
here, as in Heine’s joke “famillionaire,”
seems to be due to the fact that
the person finds it difficult to express directly
his criticism or aggression and is thus compelled
to resort to by-ways.</p>

<p class='c008'>Other subjective determinations or favorable
conditions for wit-making are less shrouded
in darkness. The motive for the production of
harmless wit is usually the ambitious impulse
to display one’s spirit or to “show off.” It is
an impulse comparable to the impulse toward
sexual exhibition. The existence of numerous
inhibited impulses whose suppression retains
some weakness produces a state favorable for
the production of tendency-wit. Thus certain
single components of the sexual constitution
may appear as motives for wit-formation. A
whole series of obscene witticisms lead one to
the conclusion that a person who gives origin
to such wit conceals a desire to exhibit. Persons
having a powerful sadistical component in
their sexuality, which is more or less inhibited
in life, are most successful with the tendency-wit
of aggression.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>
  <h4 class='c016'><em>The Impulse to Impart Wit</em></h4>
</div>

<p class='c017'>The second fact which impels one to examine
the subjective determination of wit is the common
experience that nobody is satisfied with
making wit for himself. Wit-making is inseparably
connected with the desire to impart it;
in fact this impulse is so strong that it is often
realized after overcoming strong objections.
In the comic, too, one experiences pleasure by
imparting it to another person; but this is not
imperative; one can enjoy the comic alone
when one happens on it. Wit, on the other
hand, must be imparted. Apparently the
process of wit-formation does not end with the
conception of wit. There remains something
which strives to complete the mysterious process
of wit-formation by imparting it.</p>

<p class='c008'>We cannot conjecture, in the first place,
what may have motivated the impulse to impart
wit. But in wit we notice another peculiarity
which again distinguishes it from the
comic. If I encounter the latter I can laugh
heartily over it alone; I am naturally pleased
if by imparting it to some one else I make him
laugh too. In the case of wit, however, which
occurs to me or which I have made, I cannot
laugh over it in spite of the unmistakable feeling
of pleasure which I experience in the witticism.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>It is possible that my need to impart
the witticism to another is in some way connected
with the resultant laughter, which is
manifest in the other, but denied to me.</p>

<p class='c008'>But why do I not laugh over my own joke?
And what rôle does the other person play in
it?</p>

<p class='c008'>Let us consider the last query first. In the
comic usually two persons come into consideration.
Besides my own ego there is another person
in whom I find something comic; if objects
appear comical to me, it takes place by
means of a sort of personification which is not
uncommon in our notional life. The comic
process is satisfied with these two persons, the
ego and the object person; there may also be
a third person, but it is not obligatory. Wit
as a play with one’s own words and thoughts
at first dispenses with an object person, but
already, upon the first step of the jest, it demands
another person to whom it can impart
its result, if it has succeeded in safeguarding
play and nonsense against the remonstrance
of reason. The second person in wit does not,
however, correspond to the object person, but
to the third person who is the other person in
the comic. It seems that in the jest the decision
as to whether wit has fulfilled its task is
transferred to the other person, as if the ego
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>were not quite certain of its opinion in the
matter. The harmless wit is also in need of
the other person’s support in order to ascertain
whether it has accomplished its purpose.
If wit enters the service of sexual or hostile
tendencies, it can be described as a psychic
process among three persons, just as in the
comic, with the exception that there the third
person plays a different rôle. The psychic
process of wit is consummated here between
the first person—the ego, and the third person—the
stranger, and not, as in the comic, between
the ego and the object person.</p>

<p class='c008'>Also, in the case of the third person of wit,
the wit is confronted with subjective determinations
which can make the goal of the pleasure-stimulus
unattainable. As Shakespeare says
in <cite>Love’s Labor’s Lost</cite> (Act V, Scene 2):</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c018'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“A jest’s prosperity lies in the ear</div>
      <div class='line'>Of him that hears it, never in the tongue</div>
      <div class='line'>Of him that makes it.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>He whose thoughts run in sober channels is
incompetent to declare whether or not the jest
is a good one. He himself must be in a jovial,
or at least indifferent, state of mind in order
to become the third person of the jest. The
same hindrance is present in the case of both
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>harmless and tendency-wit; but in the latter
the antagonism to the tendency which wishes
to serve wit, appears as a new hindrance. The
readiness to laugh about an excellent smutty
joke cannot manifest itself if the exposure concerns
an honored kinsman of the third person.
In an assemblage of divines and pastors no one
would dare to refer to Heine’s comparison of
Catholic and Protestant priests as retail dealers
and employees of a wholesale business. In
the presence of my opponent’s friends the wittiest
invectives with which I might assail him
would not be considered witticisms but invectives,
and in the minds of my hearers it would
create not pleasure, but indignation. A certain
amount of willingness or a certain indifference,
the absence of all factors which might
evoke strong feelings in opposition to the tendency,
are absolute conditions for the participation
of the third person in the completion of
the wit-process.</p>

<h4 class='c016'><em>The Third Person of the Witticism</em></h4>

<p class='c017'>Wherever such hindrances to the operation
of wit fail, we see the phenomenon which we
are now investigating, namely, that the pleasure
which the wit has provided manifests itself
more clearly in the third person than in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>originator of the wit. We must be satisfied to
use the expression “more clearly” where we
should be inclined to ask whether the pleasure
of the hearer is not more intensive than that of
the wit producer, because we are obviously
lacking the means of measuring and comparing
it. We see, however, that the hearer shows his
pleasure by means of explosive laughter after
the first person, in most cases with a serious
expression on his face, has related the joke.
If I repeat a witticism which I have heard, I
am forced, in order not to spoil its effect, to
conduct myself during its recital exactly like
him who made it. We may now put the question
whether from this determination of
laughter over wit we can draw conclusions concerning
the psychic process of wit-formation.</p>

<p class='c008'>Now it cannot be our intention to take into
consideration everything that has been asserted
and printed about the nature of laughter. We
are deterred from this undertaking by the
statement which Dugas, one of Ribot’s pupils,
put at the beginning of his book <cite><span lang="fr">Psychologie
du rire</span></cite> (1902). “<span lang="fr">Il n’est pas de fait plus
banal et plus étudié que le rire, il n’en est pas
qui ait eu le don d’exciter davantage la curiosité
du vulgaire et celle des philosophes, il n’ent
est pas sur lequel on ait recueilli plus d’observations
et bâti plus de théories, et avec cela
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>il n’en est pas qui demeure plus inexpliqué, on
serait tenté de dire avec les sceptiques qu’il
faut être content de rire et de ne pas chercher
à savoir pourquoi on rit, d’autant que peut-être
le réflexion tue le rire, et qu’il serait alors contradictoire
qu’elle en découvrit les causes</span>”
(page 1).</p>

<p class='c008'>On the other hand, we must make sure to
utilize for our purposes a view of the mechanism
of laughter which fits our own realm of
thought excellently. I refer to the attempted
explanation of H. Spencer in his essay entitled
<em>Physiology of Laughter</em>.<a id='r52'></a><a href='#f52' class='c007'><sup>[52]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>According to Spencer laughter is a phenomenon
of discharge of psychic irritation, and an
evidence of the fact that the psychic utilization
of this irritation has suddenly met with a
hindrance. The psychological situation, which
discharges itself in laughter, he describes in the
following words: “Laughter naturally results
only when consciousness is unawares transferred
from great things to small—only when
there is what we call a descending incongruity.”<a id='r53'></a><a href='#f53' class='c007'><sup>[53]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>In an almost analogous sense the French
authors (Dugas) designate laughter as a
“détente,” a manifestation of release of tension,
and A. Bain’s theory, “Laughter a relief
from restraint,” seems to me to approach
Spencer’s conceptions nearer than many
authors would have us believe.</p>

<p class='c008'>However, we experience the desire to modify
Spencer’s thought; to give a more definite
meaning to some of the ideas and to change
others. We would say that laughter arises
when the sum total of psychic energy, formerly
used for the occupation of certain psychic
channels, has become unutilizable so that it can
experience absolute discharge. We know what
criticism such a declaration invites, but for our
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>defense we dare cite a pertinent quotation from
Lipps’s treatise on <cite><span lang="de">Komik und Humor</span></cite>, an
analysis which throws light on other problems
besides the comic and humor. He says: “In
the end individual psychological problems always
lead us fairly deeply into psychology, so
that fundamentally no psychological problem
may be considered by itself” (p. 71). The
terms “psychic energy,” “discharge,” and the
treatment of psychic energy as a quantity have
become habitual modes of thinking since I began
to explain to myself the fact of psychopathology
philosophically. Being of the same
opinion as Lipps I have essayed to represent
in my <cite>Interpretation of Dreams</cite> the unconscious
psychic processes as real entities, and
I have not represented the conscious contents
as the “real psychic activity.”<a id='r54'></a><a href='#f54' class='c007'><sup>[54]</sup></a> Only when I
speak about the “investing energy (<i><span lang="de">Besetzung</span></i>)
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>of psychic channels,” do I seem to deviate
from the analogies that Lipps uses. The
knowledge that I have gained about the fact
that psychic energy can be displaced from one
idea to another along certain association channels,
and about the almost indestructible conservation
of the traces of psychic processes,
have actually made it possible for me to attempt
such a representation of the unknown.
In order to obviate the possibility of a misunderstanding
I must add that I am making no
attempt to proclaim that cells and fibers, or
the neuron system in vogue nowadays, represent
these psychic paths, even if such paths
would have to be represented by the organic
elements of the nervous system in a manner
which cannot yet be indicated.</p>

<h4 class='c016'><em>Laughter as a Discharge</em></h4>

<p class='c017'>Thus, according to our assumption, the conditions
for laughter are such that a sum of
psychic energy hitherto employed in the occupation
of some paths may experience free discharge.
And since not all laughter, (but
surely the laughter of wit), is a sign of pleasure,
we shall be inclined to refer this pleasure
to the release of previously existing static
energy (<i><span lang="de">Besetzungsenergie</span></i>). When we see
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>that the hearer of the witticism laughs, while
the creator of the same cannot, then that must
indicate that in the hearer a sum of damming
energy has been released and discharged,
whereas during the wit-formation, either in the
release or in the discharge, inhibitions resulted.
One can characterize the psychic process in the
hearer, in the third person of the witticism,
hardly more pointedly than by asserting that
he has bought the pleasure of the witticism
with very little expenditure on his part. One
might say that it is presented to him. The
words of the witticism which he hears necessarily
produce in him that idea or thought-connection
whose formation in him was also resisted
by great inner hindrances. He would have
had to make an effort of his own in order to
bring it about spontaneously like the first person,
or he would have had to put forth at least
as much psychic expenditure as to equalize the
force of the suppression or repression of the
inhibition. This psychic expenditure he has
saved himself; according to our former discussion
(p. 80) we should say that his pleasure
corresponds to this economy. Following our
understanding of the mechanism of laughter
we should be more likely to say that the static
energy utilized in the inhibition has now suddenly
become superfluous and neutralized because
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>a forbidden idea came into existence on
the way to auditory perception and is therefore
ready to be discharged through laughter.
Essentially both statements amount to the
same thing, for the economized expenditure
corresponds exactly to the now superfluous inhibition.
The latter statement is more obvious,
for it permits us to say that the hearer of the
witticism laughs with the amount of psychic
energy which was liberated by the suspension
of inhibition energy; that is, he laughs away,
as it were, this amount of psychic energy.</p>

<h4 class='c016'><em>Why the First Person Does Not Laugh</em></h4>

<p class='c017'>If the person in whom the witticism is
formed cannot laugh, then it indicates, as we
have just remarked, that there is a deviation
from the process in the case of the third person
which concerns either the suspension of the
inhibition energy or the discharge possibility of
the same. But the first of the two cases is inconclusive,
as we must presently see. The inhibition
energy of the first person must have
been dissipated, for otherwise there would have
been no witticism, the formation of which had
to overcome just such a resistance. Otherwise,
too, it would have been impossible for the first
person to experience the wit-pleasure which the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>removal of the inhibition forced us to deduce.
But there remains a second possibility, namely,
that even though he experienced pleasure the
first person cannot laugh, because the possibility
of discharge has been disturbed. In the
production of laughter such discharge is essential;
an interruption in the possibility of discharge
might result from the attachment of
the freed occupation energy to some immediate
endopsychic possibility. It is well that we have
become cognizant of this possibility; we shall
soon pay more attention to it. But with the
wit-maker still another condition leading to the
same result is possible. Perhaps, after all, no
appreciable amount of energy has been liberated,
in spite of the successful release of occupation
energy. In the first person of the witticism
wit-work actually takes place which
must correspond to a certain amount of fresh
psychic expenditure. Thus the first person
contributes the power which removes the inhibitions
and which surely results in a gain of
pleasure for himself; in the case of tendency-wit
it is indeed a very big gain, since the fore-pleasure
gained from the wit-work takes upon
itself the further removal of inhibitions. But
the expenditure of the wit-work is, in every
case, derived from the gain which is the result
of the removal of inhibitions; it is the same
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>expenditure which escapes from the hearer of
the witticism. To confirm what was said above
it may be added that the witticism loses its
laughter effect in the third person as soon as
an expenditure of mental work is exacted of
him. The allusions of the witticism must be
striking, and the omissions easily supplemented;
with the awakening of conscious interest in
thinking, the effect of the witticism is regularly
made impossible. Here lies the real distinction
between the witticism and the riddle. It may
be that the psychic constellations during wit-work
are not at all favorable to the free discharge
of the energy gained. We are not here
in a position to gain a deeper understanding;
our inquiry as to why the third person laughs
we have been able to clear up better than the
question why the first person does not laugh.</p>

<p class='c008'>At any rate, if we have well in mind these
views about the conditions of laughter and
about the psychic process in the third person,
we have arrived at a place where we can satisfactorily
elucidate an entire series of peculiarities
which are familiar in wit, but which have
not been understood. Before an amount of
interlocked energy, capable of discharge, is to
be liberated in the third person, there are several
conditions which must be fulfilled or which at
least are desirable. 1. It must be definitely
<span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>established that the third person really produces
this expenditure of energy. 2. Care
must be taken that when the latter becomes
freed that it should find another psychic use
instead of offering itself to the motor discharge.
3. It can be of advantage only if the
energy to be liberated in the third person is
first strengthened and heightened. Certain
processes of wit-work which we can gather together
under the caption of secondary or auxiliary
techniques serve all these purposes.</p>

<p class='c008'>The first of these conditions determines one
of the qualifications of the third person as
hearer of the witticism. He must throughout
be so completely in psychic harmony with the
first person that he makes use of the same inner
inhibitions which the wit-work has overcome in
the first person. Whoever is focused on smutty
jokes will not be able to derive pleasure from
clever exhibitionistic wit. Mr. N.’s aggressions
will not be understood by uncultured people
who are wont to give free rein to their pleasure
gained by insulting others. Every witticism
thus demands its own public, and to laugh
over the same witticisms is a proof of absolute
psychic agreement. We have indeed arrived at
a point where we are at liberty to examine even
more thoroughly the process in the third person’s
mind. The latter must be able habitually
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>to produce the same inhibition which the joke
has surmounted in the first person, so that, as
soon as he hears the joke, there awakens within
him compulsively and automatically a readiness
for this inhibition. This readiness for the inhibition,
which I must conceive as a true expenditure
analogous to the mobilization of an
army, is simultaneously recognized as superfluous
or as belated, and is thus immediately
discharged in its nascent state through the
channel of laughter.<a id='r55'></a><a href='#f55' class='c007'><sup>[55]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>The second condition for the production of
the free discharge, a cutting off of any other
outlets for the liberated energy, seems to me of
far greater importance. It furnishes the theoretical
explanation for the uncertainty of the
effect of wit; if the thoughts expressed in the
witticism evoke very exciting ideas in the
hearer, (depending on the agreement or antagonism
between the wit’s tendencies and the
train of thought dominating the hearer), the
witty process either receives or is refused attention.
Of still greater theoretical interest,
however, are a series of auxiliary wit-techniques
which obviously serve the purpose of
diverting the attention of the listeners from the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>wit-process so as to allow the latter to proceed
automatically. I advisedly use the term “automatically”
rather than “unconsciously” because
the latter designation might prove misleading.
It is only a question of keeping the
psychic process from getting more than its
share of attention during the recital of the witticism,
and the usefulness of these auxiliary
techniques permits us to assume rightfully that
it is just the occupation of attention which has
a large share in the control and in the fresh
utilization of the freed energy of occupation.</p>

<h4 class='c016'><em>The Automatism of the Wit-process</em></h4>

<p class='c017'>It seems to be by no means easy to avoid
the endopsychic utilization of energy that has
become superfluous, for in our mental processes
we are constantly in the habit of transferring
such emotional outputs from one path to
another without losing any of their energy
through discharge. Wit prevents this in the
following way. In the first place it strives
for the shortest possible expression in order
to expose less points of attack to the attention.
Secondly, it strictly adheres to the condition
that it be easily understood (<em>v. s.</em>), for as soon
as it has recourse to mental effort or demands
a choice between different mental paths, it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>imperils the effect not only through the unavoidable
mental expenditure, but also through
the awakening of attention. Besides this, wit
also makes use of the artifice of diverting the
attention by offering to it something in the expression
of the witticism which fascinates it so
that meanwhile the liberation of inhibition
energy and its discharge can take place undisturbed.
The omissions in the wording of wit
already carry out this intention. They impel
us to fill in the gaps and in this way they keep
the wit-process free from attention. The technique
of the riddle, as it were, which attracts
attention is here pressed into the service of the
wit-work. The façade formations, which we
have already discovered in many groups of
tendency-wit, are still more effective (see p.
155). The syllogistical façades excellently fulfill
the purpose of riveting the attention by an
allotted task. While we begin to ponder
wherein the given answer was lacking already
we are laughing; our attention has been surprised,
and the discharge of the liberated emotional
inhibition has been effected. The same
is true of witticisms possessing a comic façade
in which the comic serves to assist the wit-technique.
A comic façade promotes the effect
of wit in more than one way; it makes
possible not only the automatism of the wit-process
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>by riveting the attention, but also it
facilitates the discharge of wit by sending
ahead a discharge from the comic. Here the
effect of the comic resembles that of a fascinating
fore-pleasure, and we can thus understand
that many witticisms are able to dispense entirely
the fore-pleasures produced by other
means of wit, and make use of only the comic
as a fore-pleasure. Among the true techniques
of wit it is especially displacement and representation
through absurdity which, besides
other properties, also develop the deviation of
attention so desirable for the automatic discharge
of the wit-process.<a id='r56'></a><a href='#f56' class='c007'><sup>[56]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>We already surmise, and later will be able
to see more clearly, that in this condition of
deviation of attention we have disclosed no unessential
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>characteristic of the psychic process
in the hearer of wit. In conjunction with this,
we can understand something more. First,
how it happens that we rarely ever know in a
joke why we are laughing, although by analytical
investigation we can determine the
cause. This laughing is the result of an automatic
process which was first made possible by
keeping our conscious attention at a distance.
Secondly, we arrive at an understanding of
that characteristic of wit as a result of which
wit can exert its full effect on the hearer only
when it is new and when it comes to him as
a surprise. This property of wit, which causes
wit to be short-lived and forever urges the
production of new wit, is evidently due to the
fact that it is inherent in the surprising or the
unexpected to succeed but once. When we repeat
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>wit the awakened memory leads the attention
to the first hearing. This also explains
the desire to impart wit to others who have not
heard it before, for the impression made by
wit on the new hearer replenishes that part of
the pleasure which has been lost by the lack of
novelty. And an analogous motive probably
urges the wit producer to impart his wit to
others.</p>

<h4 class='c016'><em>Elements Favoring the Wit-process</em></h4>

<p class='c017'>As elements favoring the wit-process, even
if we can no longer consider them essentials,
I present in the third place three technical
aids to wit-work which are destined to increase
the sums of energy to be discharged and thus
enhance the effect of the wit. These technical
aids also very often accentuate the attention
directed to the wit, but they neutralize its influence
by simultaneously fascinating it and
impeding its movements. Everything that
provokes interest and confusion exerts its influence
in these two directions. This is especially
true of the nonsense and contrast elements,
and above all the “contrast of ideas,”
which some authors consider the essential character
of wit, but in which I see only a means
to reinforce the effect of wit. All that is confusing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>evokes in the hearer that condition of
distribution of energy which Lipps has designated
as “psychic damming”; and, doubtless,
he has a right to assume that the force of the
“discharge” varies with the success of the
damming process which precedes it. Lipps’s exposition
does not explicitly refer to wit, but to
the comic in general, yet it seems quite probable
that the discharge in wit, releasing a gush
of inhibition energy, is brought to its height
in a similar manner by means of the damming.</p>

<p class='c008'>At length we are aware that the technique
of wit is really determined by two kinds of
tendencies, those which make possible the
formation of wit in the first person, and those
guaranteeing that the witticism produces in the
third person as much pleasurable effect as possible.
The Janus-like double-facedness of
wit, which safeguards its original resultant
pleasure against the impugnment of critical
reason, belongs to the first tendency together
with the mechanism of fore-pleasure; the other
complications of technique produced by the
conditions discussed in this chapter concern the
third person of the witticism. Thus wit in itself
is a double-tongued villain which serves
two masters at the same time. Everything
that aims toward gaining pleasure is calculated
by the witticism to arouse the third person, as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>if inner, unsurmountable inhibitions in the first
person were in the way of the same. Thus one
gets the full impression of the absolute necessity
of this third person for the completion of
the wit-process. But while we have succeeded
in obtaining a good insight concerning the nature
of this process in the third person, we feel
that the corresponding process in the first person
is still shrouded in darkness. So far we
have not succeeded in answering the first of
our two questions: Why can we not laugh
over wit made by ourselves? and: Why are we
urged to impart our own witticisms to others?
We can only suspect that there is an intimate
connection between the two facts yet to be explained,
and that we must impart our witticisms
to others for the reason that we ourselves
are unable to laugh over them. From
our examinations of the conditions in the third
person for pleasure gaining and pleasure discharging
we can draw the conclusion that in
the first person the conditions for discharge
are lacking and that those for gaining pleasure
are only incompletely fulfilled. Thus it is not
to be disputed that we enhance our pleasure
in that we attain the—to us impossible—laughter
in this roundabout way from the impression
of the person who was stimulated to
laughter. Thus we laugh, so to speak, <i><span lang="fr">par
<span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>ricochet</span></i>, as Dugas expresses it. Laughter
belongs to those manifestations of psychic
states which are highly infectious; if I make
some one else laugh by imparting my wit to
him, I am really using him as a tool in order
to arouse my own laughter. One can really
notice that the person who at first recites the
witticism with a serious mien later joins the
hearer with a moderate amount of laughter.
Imparting my witticisms to others may thus
serve several purposes. First, it serves to give
me the objective certainty of the success of the
wit-work; secondly, it serves to enhance my
own pleasure through the reaction of the hearer
upon myself; thirdly, in the case of repeating
a not original joke, it serves to remedy the loss
of pleasure due to the lack of novelty.</p>

<h4 class='c016'><em>Economy and Full Expenditure</em></h4>

<p class='c017'>At the end of these discussions about the
psychic processes of wit, in so far as they are
enacted between two persons, we can glance
back to the factor of economy which impressed
us as an important item in the psychological
conception of wit since we offered the first explanation
of wit-technique. Long ago we dismissed
the nearest but also the simplest conception
of this economy, where it was a matter
<span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>of avoiding psychic expenditure in general by
a maximum restriction in the use of words and
by the production of associations of ideas. We
had then already asserted that brevity and
laconisms are not witty in themselves. The
brevity of wit is a peculiar one; it has to be
a “witty” brevity. The original pleasure
gain produced by playing with words and
thoughts resulted, to be sure, from simple
economy in expenditure, but with the development
of play into wit the tendency to economize
also had to shift its goals, for whatever
might be saved by the use of the same words
or by avoiding new thought connections would
surely be of no account when compared to the
colossal expenditure of our mental activity.
We may be permitted to make a comparison
between the psychic economy and a business
enterprise. So long as the latter’s transactions
are very small, good policy demands that expenses
be kept low and that the costs of operation
be minimized as much as possible.
The economy still follows the absolute height
of the expenditure. Later on when the volume
of business has increased, the importance
of the business expenses dwindles; increases in
the expenditure totals matter little so long as
the transactions and returns can be sufficiently
increased. Keeping down running expenses
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>would be parsimonious; in fact, it would mean
a direct loss. Nevertheless it would be equally
false to assume that with a very great expenditure
there would be no more room for saving.
The manager inclined to economize would now
make an effort to save on particular things and
would feel satisfied if the same establishment,
with its costly upkeep, could reduce its expenses
at all, no matter how small the saving
would seem in comparison to the entire expenditure.
In quite an analogous manner the
detailed economy in our complicated psychic
affairs remains a source of pleasure, as may be
shown by everyday occurrences. Whoever
used to have a gas lamp in his room, but now
uses electric light, will experience for a long
time a definite feeling of pleasure when he
presses the electric light button; this pleasure
continues as long as at that moment he remembers
the complicated arrangements necessary
to light the gas lamp. Similarly the economy
of expenditure in psychic inhibition brought
about by wit—small though it may be in comparison
to the sum total of psychic expenditure—will
remain a source of pleasure for us,
because we thereby save a particular expenditure
which we were wont to make and which
as before we were ready to make. That the
expenditure is expected and prepared for is a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>factor which stands unmistakably in the foreground.</p>

<p class='c008'>A localized economy, as the one just considered,
will not fail to give us momentary pleasure,
but it will not bring about a lasting alleviation
so long as what has been saved here
can be utilized in another place. Only when
this disposal into a different path can be
avoided, will the special economy be transformed
into a general alleviation of the psychic
expenditures. Thus, with clearer insight into
the psychic processes of wit, we see that the factor
of alleviation takes the place of economy.
Obviously the former gives us the greater feeling
of pleasure. The process in the first person
of the witticism produces pleasure by removing
inhibitions and by diminishing local expenditure;
it does not, however, seem to come
to rest until it succeeds through the intervention
of the third person in attaining general
relief through discharge.</p>

  <h3 class='c001'>VI.<br> <span class='c015'>THE RELATION OF WIT TO DREAMS AND TO THE UNCONSCIOUS</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c006'>At the end of the chapter which dealt with
the elucidation of the technique of wit (p. 125)
we asserted that the processes of condensation
with and without substitutive formation, displacement,
representation through absurdity,
representation through the opposite, indirect
representation, etc., all of which we found participated
in the formation of wit, evinced a
far-reaching agreement with the processes of
“dream-work.” We promised, at that time,
first to examine more carefully these similarities,
and secondly, so far as such indications
point to search for what is common to both wit
and dreams. The discussion of this comparison
would be much easier for us if we could
assume that one of the subjects to be compared—the
“dream-work”—were well known.
But we shall probably do better not to take
this assumption for granted. I received the
impression that my book <cite>The Interpretation
of Dreams</cite> created more “confusion” than
“enlightenment” among my colleagues, and I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>know that the wider reading circles have contented
themselves to reduce the contents of
the book to a catchword, “Wish fulfillment”—a
term easily remembered and easily abused.</p>

<p class='c008'>However, in my continued occupation with
the problems considered therein, for the study
of which my practice as a psychotherapeutist
affords me much opportunity, I found nothing
that would impel me to change or improve on
my ideas; I can therefore peacefully wait until
the reader’s comprehension has risen to my
level, or until an intelligent critic has pointed
out to me the basic faults in my conception.
For the purposes of comparison with wit, I
shall briefly review the most important features
of dreams and dream-work.</p>

<p class='c008'>We know dreams by the recollection which
usually seems fragmentary and which occurs
upon awakening. It is then a structure made
up mostly of visual or other sensory impressions,
which represents to us a deceptive picture
of an experience, and may be mingled
with mental processes (the “knowledge” in
the dream) and emotional manifestations.
What we thus remember as a dream I call
“the manifest dream-content.” The latter is
often altogether absurd and confused, at other
times it is merely one part or another that is
so affected. But even if it be entirely coherent,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>as in the case of some anxiety dreams, it stands
out in our psychic life as something strange,
for the origin of which one cannot account.
Until recently the explanation for these peculiarities
of the dream has been sought in the
dream itself in that it was considered roughly
speaking an indication of a muddled, dissociated,
and “sleepy” activity of the nervous elements.</p>

<p class='c008'>As opposed to this view I have shown that
the excessively peculiar “manifest” dream-content
can regularly be made comprehensible,
and that it is a disfigured and changed
transcription of certain correct psychic formations
which deserve the name of “latent dream-thoughts.”
One gains an understanding of
the latter by resolving the manifest dream-content
into its component parts without regard
for its apparent meaning, and then by following
up the threads of associations which emanate
from each one of the now isolated elements.
These become interwoven and in the
end lead to a structure of thoughts, which is
not only entirely accurate, but also fits easily
into the familiar associations of our psychic
processes. During this “analysis” the dream-content
loses all of the peculiarities so strange
to us; but if the analysis is to be successful,
we must firmly cast aside the critical objections
<span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>which incessantly arise against the reproduction
of the individual associations.</p>

<h4 class='c016'><em>The Dream-work</em></h4>

<p class='c017'>From the comparison of the remembered
manifest dream-content with the latent dream-thoughts
thus discovered there arises the conception
of “dream-work.” The entire sum of
the transforming processes which have changed
the latent dream-thought into the manifest
dream is called the dream-work. The astonishment
which formerly the dream evoked in
us is now perceived to be due to the dream-work.</p>

<p class='c008'>The function of the dream-work may be
described in the following manner. A structure
of thoughts, mostly very complicated,
which has been built up during the day and
not brought to settlement—a day remnant—clings
firmly even during night to the energy
which it had assumed—the underlying center
of interest—and thus threatens to disturb sleep.
This day remnant is transformed into a dream
by the dream-work and in this way rendered
harmless to sleep. But in order to make possible
its employment by the dream-work, this
day remnant must be capable of being cast
into the form of a wish, a condition that is not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>difficult to fulfill. The wish emanating from
the dream-thoughts forms the first step and
later on the nucleus of the dream. Experience
gained from analyses—not the theory of the
dream—teaches us that with children a fond
wish left from the waking state suffices to
evoke a dream, which is coherent and senseful,
but almost always short, and easily recognizable
as a “wish fulfillment.” In the case of
adults the universally valid condition for the
dream-creating wish seems to be that the latter
should appear foreign to conscious thinking,
that is, it should be a repressed wish, or that
it should supply consciousness with reinforcement
from unknown sources. Without the assumption
of the unconscious activity in the
sense used above, I should be at a loss to develop
further the theory of dreams and to explain
the material gleaned from experience in
dream-analyses. The action of this unconscious
wish upon the logical conscious material of
dream-thoughts now results in the dream. The
latter is thereby drawn down into the unconscious,
as it were, or to speak more precisely,
it is exposed to a treatment which usually
takes place at the level of unconscious mental
activity, and which is characteristic of this
mental level. Only from the results of the
“dream-work” have we thus far learned to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>know the qualities of this unconscious mental
activity and its differentiation from the “foreconscious”
which is capable of consciousness.</p>

<h4 class='c016'><em>The Unconscious</em></h4>

<p class='c017'>A novel and difficult theory that runs
counter to our habitual modes of thinking can
hardly gain in lucidity by a condensed exposition.
I can therefore accomplish little more
in this discussion than refer the reader to the
detailed treatment of the unconscious in my
<cite>Interpretation of Dreams</cite>, and also to Lipps’s
work, which I consider most important. I
am aware that he who is under the spell of
a good old philosophical training, or stands
aloof from a so-called philosophical system,
will oppose the assumption of the “unconscious
psychic processes” in Lipps’s sense and in mine
and will desire to prove the impossibility of it
preferably by means of definitions of the term
psychic. But definitions are conventional and
changeable. I have often found that persons
who dispute the unconscious on the grounds of
its absurdity or impossibility have not received
their impressions from those sources from
which I, at least, have found it necessary to
draw, in order to become aware of its existence.
These opponents had never witnessed the effect
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>of a posthypnotic suggestion, and they
were immensely surprised at the evidence I
imparted to them gleaned from my analysis of
unhypnotized neurotics. They had never
gained the conception of the unconscious as
something which one does not really know,
while cogent proofs force one to supplement
this idea by saying that one understands by
the unconscious something capable of consciousness,
something concerning which one has
not thought and which is not in the field of
vision of consciousness. Nor had they attempted
to convince themselves of the existence
of such unconscious thoughts in their own
psychic life by means of an analysis of one
of their own dreams, and when I attempted
this with them, they could perceive their
own mental occurrences only with astonishment
and confusion. I have also gotten
the impression that these are essentially affective
resistances which stand in the way of
the acceptation of the “unconscious,” and that
they are based on the fact that no one is desirous
of becoming acquainted with his unconscious,
and it is most convenient to deny altogether
its possibility.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>
  <h4 class='c016'><em>Condensation and Displacement in the Dream-work</em></h4>
</div>

<p class='c017'>The dream-work, to which I return after
this digression, subjects the thought material
uttered in the optative mood to a very peculiar
elaboration. First of all it proceeds from the
optative to the indicative mood; it substitutes
“it is” for “would it were!” This “it
is” is destined to become part of an hallucinatory
representation which I have called the
“regression” of the dream-work. This regression
represents the path from the mental
images to the sensory perceptions of the same,
or if one chooses to speak with reference to
the still unfamiliar—not to be understood
anatomically—topic of the psychic apparatus,
it is the region of the thought-formation to the
region of the sensory perception. Along this
road which runs in an opposite direction to the
course of development of psychic complications
the dream-thoughts gain in clearness; a plastic
situation finally results as a nucleus of the
manifest “dream picture.” In order to arrive
at such a sensory representation the dream-thoughts
have had to experience tangible
changes in their expression. But while the
thoughts are changed back into mental images
they are subjected to still greater changes,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>some of which are easily conceivable as necessary,
while others are surprising. As a necessary
secondary result of the regression one
understands that nearly all relationships within
the thoughts which have organized the same
are lost to the manifest dream. The dream-work
takes over, as it were, only the raw material
of the ideas for representation, and not
the thought-relations which held each other in
check; or at least it reserves the freedom of
leaving the latter out of the question. On the
other hand, there is a certain part of the dream-work
which cannot be traced to the regression
or to the recasting into mental images; it is
just that part which is significant to us for the
analogy to wit-formation. The material of the
dream-thoughts experiences an extraordinary
compression or <em>condensation</em> during the dream-work.
The starting-points of this condensation
are those points which are common to two
or more dream-thoughts because they naturally
pertain to both or because they are inevitable
consequences of the contents of two or more
dream-thoughts, and since these points do not
regularly suffice for a prolific condensation
new artificial and fleeting common points come
into existence, and for this purpose preferably
words are used which combine different meanings
in their sounds. The newly framed common
<span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>points of condensation enter as representatives
of the dream-thoughts into the manifest
dream-content, so that an element of the dream
corresponds to a point of junction or intersection
of the dream-thoughts, and with regard
to the latter it must in general be called “overdetermined.”
The process of condensation is
that part of the dream-work which is most
easily recognizable; it suffices to compare the
recorded wording of a dream with the written
dream-thoughts gained by means of analysis,
in order to get a good impression of the productiveness
of dream condensation.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is not easy to convince one’s self of the
second great change that takes place in the
dream-thoughts through the agency of the
dream-work. I refer to that process which I
have called the dream <em>displacement</em>. It manifests
itself by the fact that what occupies the
center of the manifest dream and is endowed
with vivid sensory intensity has occupied a
peripheral and secondary position in the dream-thoughts,
and <em>vice versa</em>. This process causes
the dream to appear out of proportion when
compared with the dream-thoughts, and it is
because of this displacement that it seems
strange and incomprehensible to the waking
state. In order that such a displacement
should occur it must be possible for the occupation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>energy to pass uninhibited from important
to insignificant ideas,—a process which
in normal conscious thinking can only give the
impression of “faulty thinking.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Transformation into expressive activity, condensation,
and displacement are the three
great functions which we can ascribe to the
dream-work. A fourth, to which too little attention
was given in <cite>The Interpretation of
Dreams</cite>, does not come into consideration here
for our purpose. In a consistent elucidation
of the ideas dealing with the “topic of the
psychic apparatus” and “regression,” which
alone can lend value to these working hypotheses,
an effort would have to be made to
determine at what stages of regression the various
transformations of the dream-thoughts occur.
As yet no serious effort has been made
in this direction, but at least we can speak
definitely about displacement when we say that
it must arise in the thought material while the
latter is in the level of the unconscious processes.
One will probably have to think of
condensation as a process that extends over the
entire course up to the outposts of the perceptive
region; but in general it suffices to assume
that there is a simultaneous activity of all the
forces which participate in the formation of
dreams. In view of the reserve which one must
<span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>naturally exercise in the treatment of such
problems, and in consideration of the inability
to discuss here the main objections to these
problems, I should like to trust somewhat to
the assertion that the process of the dream-work
which prepares the dream is situated in
the region of the unconscious. Roughly speaking,
one can distinguish three general stages
in the formation of the dream; first, the transference
of the conscious day remnants into the
unconscious, a transference in which the conditions
of the sleeping state must co-operate;
secondly, the actual dream-work in the
unconscious; and thirdly, the regression of
the elaborated dream material to the region
of perception, whereby the dream becomes
conscious.</p>

<p class='c008'>The forces participating in the dream-formation
may be recognized as the following: the
wish to sleep; the sum of occupation energy
which still clings to the day remnants after the
depression brought about by the state of sleep;
the psychic energy of the unconscious wish
forming the dream; and the opposing force of
the “<em>censor</em>,” which exercises its authority in
our waking state, and is not entirely abolished
during sleep. The task of dream-formation is,
above all, to overcome the inhibition of the
censor, and it is just this task that is fulfilled
<span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>by the displacement of the psychic energy
within the material of the dream-thoughts.</p>

<h4 class='c016'><em>The Formula for Wit-work</em></h4>

<p class='c017'>Now we recall what caused us to think of
the dream while investigating wit. We found
that the character and activity of wit were
bound up in certain forms of expression and
technical means, among which the various
forms of condensation, displacement, and indirect
representation were the most conspicuous.
But the processes which led to the same results—condensation,
displacement, and indirect expression—we
learned to know as peculiarities
of dream-work. Does not this analogy almost
force us to the conclusion that wit-work and
dream-work must be identical at least in one
essential point? I believe that the dream-work
lies revealed before us in its most important
characters, but in wit we find obscured just
that portion of the psychic processes which we
may compare with the dream-work, namely,
the process of wit-formation in the first person.
Shall we not yield to the temptation to
construct this process according to the analogy
of dream-formation? Some of the characteristics
of dreams are so foreign to wit that that
part of the dream-work corresponding to them
<span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>cannot be carried over to the wit-formation. The
regression of the stream of thought to perception
certainly falls away as far as wit is concerned.
However, the other two stages of
dream-formation, the sinking of a foreconscious<a id='r57'></a><a href='#f57' class='c007'><sup>[57]</sup></a>
thought into the unconscious, and the
unconscious elaboration, would give us exactly
the result which we might observe in wit if we
assumed this process in wit-formation. Let us
decide to assume that this is the proceeding of
wit-formation in the case of the first person.
<em>A foreconscious thought is left for a moment
to unconscious elaboration and the results are
forthwith grasped by the conscious perception.</em></p>

<p class='c008'>Before, however, we attempt to prove the
details of this assertion we wish to consider an
objection which may jeopardize our assumption.
We start with the fact that the techniques of
wit point to the same processes which become
known to us as peculiarities of dream-work.
Now it is an easy matter to say in opposition
that we would not have described the techniques
of wit as condensation, displacement,
etc., nor would we have arrived at such a comprehensive
agreement in the means of representation
of wit and dreams, if our previous
knowledge of dream-work had not influenced
our conception of the technique of wit; so that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>at the bottom we find that wit confirms only
those tentative theories which we brought to it
from our study of dreams. Such a genesis of
agreement would be no certain guarantee of its
stability beyond our preconceived judgment.
No other author has thought of considering
condensation, displacement, and indirect expression
as active factors of wit. This might
be a possible objection, but nevertheless it
would not be justified. It might just as well
be said that in order to recognize the real
agreement between dreams and wit our ordinary
knowledge must be augmented by a
specialized knowledge of dream-work. However,
the decision will really depend only upon
the question whether the examining critic can
prove that such a conception of the technique
of wit in the individual examples is forced, and
that other nearer and farther-reaching interpretations
have been suppressed in favor of
mine; or whether the critic will have to admit
that the tentative theories derived from the
study of dreams can be really confirmed
through wit. My opinion is that we have
nothing to fear from such a critic and that
our processes of reduction have confidently
pointed out in which forms of expression
we must search for the techniques of wit.
That we designated these techniques by names
<span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>which previously anticipated the result of the
agreement between the technique of wit and
the dream-work was our just prerogative, and
really nothing more than an easily justified
simplification.</p>

<p class='c008'>There is still another objection which would
not be vital, but which could not be so completely
refuted. One might think that the
techniques of wit that fit in so well considering
the ends we have in view deserve recognition,
but that they do not represent all possible
techniques of wit or even all those in use.
Also that we have selected only the techniques
of wit which were influenced by and would suit
the pattern of the dream-work, whereas others
ignored by us would have demonstrated that
such an agreement was not common to all
cases. I really do not trust myself to make the
assertion that I have succeeded in explaining
all the current witticisms with reference to
their techniques, and I therefore admit the
possibility that my enumeration of wit-techniques
may show many gaps. But I have not
purposely excluded from my discussion any
form of technique that was clear to me, and I
can affirm that the most frequent, the most essential,
and the most characteristic technical
means of wit have not eluded my attention.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>
  <h4 class='c016'><em>Wit as an Inspiration</em></h4>
</div>

<p class='c017'>Wit possesses still another character which
entirely corresponds to our conception of the
wit-work as originally discovered in our study
of dreams. It is true that it is common to hear
one say “I <em>made</em> a joke,” but one feels that
one behaves differently during this process
than when one pronounces a judgment or offers
an objection. Wit shows in a most pronounced
manner the character of an involuntary
“inspiration” or a sudden flash of
thought. A moment before one cannot tell
what kind of joke one is going to make, though
it lacks only the words to clothe it. One
usually experiences something indefinable
which I should like most to compare to an
absence, or sudden drop of intellectual tension;
then all of a sudden the witticism appears,
usually simultaneously with its verbal investment.
Some of the means of wit are also
utilized in the expression of thought along
other lines, as in the cases of comparison and
allusion. I can purposely will to make an allusion.
In doing this I have first in mind (in
the inner hearing) the direct expression of my
thought, but as I am inhibited from expressing
the same through some objection from the situation
in question, I almost resolve to substitute
<span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>the direct expression by a form of indirect
expression, and then I utter it in the form
of an allusion. But the allusion that comes
into existence in this manner having been
formed under my continuous control is never
witty, no matter how useful it may be. On
the other hand, the witty allusion appears
without my having been able to follow
up these preparatory stages in my mind.
I do not wish to attribute too much value to
this procedure, it is scarcely decisive, but it
does agree well with our assumption that in
wit-formation a stream of thought is dropped
for a moment and suddenly emerges from the
unconscious as a witticism.</p>

<p class='c008'>Witticisms also evince a peculiar behavior
along the lines of association of ideas. Frequently
they are not at the disposal of our
memory when we look for them; on the other
hand, they often appear unsolicited and at
places in our train of thought where we cannot
understand their presence. Again, these are
only minor qualities, but none the less they
point to their unconscious origin.</p>

<p class='c008'>Let us now collect the properties of wit
whose formation can be referred to the unconscious.
Above all there is the peculiar brevity
of wit which, though not an indispensable, is a
marked and distinctive characteristic feature.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>When we first encountered it we were inclined
to see in it an expression of a tendency to
economize, but owing to very evident objections
we ourselves depreciated the value of this
conception. At present we look upon it more
as a sign of the unconscious elaboration which
the thought of wit has undergone. The
process of condensation which corresponds to
it in dreams we can correlate with no other
factor than with the localization in the unconscious,
and we must assume that the conditions
for such condensations which are lacking in the
foreconscious are present in the unconscious
mental process.<a id='r58'></a><a href='#f58' class='c007'><sup>[58]</sup></a> It is to be expected that in
the process of condensation some of the elements
subjected to it become lost, while others
which take over their occupation energy are
strengthened by the condensation or are built
up too energetically. The brevity of wit, like
the brevity of dreams, would thus be a necessary
concomitant manifestation of the condensation
which occurs in both cases; both
times it is a result of the condensation process.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>The brevity of wit is indebted also to this
origin for its peculiar character which though
not further assignable produces a striking impression.</p>

<h4 class='c016'><em>The Unconscious and the Infantile</em></h4>

<p class='c017'>We have defined above the one result
of condensation—the manifold application
of the same material, play upon words, and
similarity of sound—as a localized economy,
and have also referred the pleasure produced
by harmless wit to that economy. At a later
place we have found that the original purpose
of wit consisted in producing this kind of pleasure
from words, a process which was permitted
to the individual during the stage of playing,
but which became banked in during the course
of intellectual development or by rational criticism.
Now we have decided upon the assumption
that such condensations as serve the technique
of wit originate automatically and without
any particular purpose during the process
of thinking in the unconscious. Have we not
here two different conceptions of the same fact
which seem to be incompatible with each other?
I do not think so. To be sure, there are two
different conceptions, and they demand to be
brought in unison, but they do not contradict
<span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>each other. They are merely somewhat
strange to each other, and as soon as we have
established a relationship between them we
shall probably gain in knowledge. That such
condensations are sources of pleasure is in perfect
accord with the supposition that they
easily find in the unconscious the conditions
necessary for their origin; on the other hand,
we see the motivation for the sinking into the
unconscious in the circumstance that the pleasure-bringing
condensation necessary to wit
easily results there. Two other factors also,
which upon first examination seem entirely
foreign to each other and which are brought
together quite accidentally, will be recognized
on deeper investigation as intimately
connected, and perhaps may be found to
be substantially the same. I am referring
to the two assertions that on the one hand
wit could form such pleasure-bringing condensations
during its development in the stage
of playing, that is, during the infancy of reason;
and, on the other hand, that it accomplishes
the same function on higher levels by
submerging the thought into the unconscious.
For the infantile is the source of the unconscious.
The unconscious mental processes are
no others than those which are solely produced
during infancy. The thought which sinks into
<span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>the unconscious for the purpose of wit-formation
only revisits there the old homestead of
the former playing with words. The thought
is put back for a moment into the infantile
state in order to regain in this way childish
pleasure-sources. If, indeed, one were not already
acquainted with it from the investigation
of the psychology of the neuroses, wit would
surely impress one with the idea that the peculiar
unconscious elaboration is nothing else
but the infantile type of the mental process.
Only it is by no means an easy matter to
grasp, in the unconscious of the adult, this peculiar
infantile manner of thinking, because it
is usually corrected, so to say, <i><span lang="la">statu nascendi</span></i>.
However, it is successfully grasped in a series
of cases, and then we always laugh about the
“childish stupidity.” In fact every exposure
of such an unconscious fact affects us in a
“comical” manner.<a id='r59'></a><a href='#f59' class='c007'><sup>[59]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>It is easier to comprehend the character of
these unconscious mental processes in the utterances
of patients suffering from various psychic
<span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>disturbances. It is very probable that,
following the assumption of old Griesinger,
we would be in a position to understand the
deliria of the insane and to turn them to good
account as valuable information, if we would
not make the demands of conscious thinking
upon them, but instead treat them as we do
dreams by means of our art of interpretation.<a id='r60'></a><a href='#f60' class='c007'><sup>[60]</sup></a>
In the dream, too, we were able to show the
“return of psychic life to the embryonal state.”<a id='r61'></a><a href='#f61' class='c007'><sup>[61]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>In discussing the processes of condensation
we have entered so deeply into the signification
of the analogy between wit and dreams that we
can here be brief. As we know that displacements
in dream-work point to the influence of
the censor of conscious thought, we will consequently
be inclined to assume that an inhibiting
force also plays a part in the formation of
wit when we find the process of displacement
among the techniques of wit. We also know
that this is commonly the case; the endeavor of
wit to revive the old pleasure in nonsense or
the old pleasure in word-play meets with resistance
in every normal state, a resistance
which is exerted by the protest of critical reason,
and which must be overcome in each individual
<span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>case. But a radical distinction between
wit and dreams is shown in the manner
in which the wit-work solves this difficulty. In
the dream-work the solution of this task is
brought about regularly through displacements
and through the choice of ideas which are remote
enough from the objectionable ones to
secure passage through the censor; the latter
themselves are but offsprings of those whose
psychic energy they have taken upon themselves
through full transference. The displacements
are therefore not lacking in any
dream and are far more comprehensive; they not
only comprise the deviations from the trend of
thought but also all forms of indirect expression,
the substitution for an important but offensive
element of one seemingly indifferent and harmless
to the censor which form very remote allusions
to the first, they include substitution also
occurring through symbols, comparisons, or
trifles. It is not to be denied that parts of this
indirect representation really originate in the
foreconscious thoughts of the dream,—as, for
example, symbolical representation and representation
through comparisons—because otherwise
the thought would not have reached the state
of the foreconscious expression. Such indirect
expressions and allusions, whose reference
to the original thought is easily findable, are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>really permissible and customary means of expression
even in our conscious thought. The
dream-work, however, exaggerates the application
of these means of indirect expression to an
unlimited degree. Under the pressure of the
censor any kind of association becomes good
enough for substitution by allusion; the displacement
from one element to any other is
permitted. The substitution of the inner associations
(similarity, causal connection, etc.)
by the so-called outer associations (simultaneity,
contiguity in space, assonance) is particularly
conspicuous and characteristic of the
dream-work.</p>

<h4 class='c016'><em>The Difference between Dream-technique and Wit-technique</em></h4>

<p class='c017'>All these means of displacement also occur
as techniques of wit, but when they do occur
they usually restrict themselves to those limits
prescribed for their use in conscious thought;
in fact they may be lacking, even though wit
must regularly solve a task of inhibition. One
can comprehend this retirement of the process
of displacement in wit-work when one remembers
that wit usually has another technique at
its disposal through which it defends itself
against inhibitions. Indeed, we have discovered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>nothing more characteristic of it than just
this technique. For wit does not have recourse
to compromises as does the dream, nor does it
evade the inhibition; it insists upon retaining
the play with words or nonsense unaltered, but
thanks to the ambiguity of words and multiplicity
of thought-relations, it restricts itself to
the choice of cases in which this play or nonsense
may appear at the same time admissible
(jest) or senseful (wit). Nothing distinguishes
wit from all other psychic formations
better than this double-sidedness and this double-dealing;
by emphasizing the “sense in nonsense,”
the authors have approached nearest
the understanding of wit, at least from this angle.</p>

<p class='c008'>Considering the unexceptional predominance
of this peculiar technique in overcoming inhibitions
in wit, one might find it superfluous that
wit should make use of the displacement-technique
even in a single case. But on the one
hand certain kinds of this technique remain
useful for wit as objects and sources of pleasure—as,
for example, the real displacement
(deviation of the trend of thought) which in
fact shares in the nature of nonsense,—and on
the other hand one must not forget that the
highest stage of wit, tendency-wit, must frequently
overcome two kinds of inhibitions which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>oppose both itself and its tendency (p. 147),
and that allusion and displacements are qualified
to facilitate this latter task.</p>

<p class='c008'>The numerous and unrestricted application
of indirect representation, of displacements,
and especially of allusions in the dream-work,
has a result which I mention not because of
its own significance but because it became for
me the subjective inducement to occupy myself
with the problem of wit. If a dream
analysis is imparted to one unfamiliar with the
subject and unaccustomed to it, and the peculiar
ways of allusions and displacements
(objectionable to the waking thoughts but
utilized by the dream-work) are explained, the
hearer experiences an uncomfortable impression;
he declares these interpretations to be
“witty,” but it seems obvious to him that these
are not successful jokes but forced ones which
run contrary to the rules of wit. This impression
can be easily explained; it is due to the
fact that the dream-work operates with the
same means as wit, but in the application of
the same the dream exceeds the bounds which
wit restricts. We shall soon learn that in consequence
of the rôle of the third person wit
is bound by a certain condition which does not
affect the dream.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>
  <h4 class='c016'><em>Irony—Negativism</em></h4>
</div>

<p class='c017'>Among those techniques which are common
to both wit and dreams representation through
the opposite and the application of absurdity
are especially interesting. The first belongs
to the strongly effective means of wit as shown
in the examples of “outdoing wit” (p. <a href='#Page_98'>98</a>).
The representation through the opposite, unlike
most of the wit-techniques, is unable to
withdraw itself from conscious attention. He
who intentionally tries to make use of wit-work,
as in the case of the “habitual wit,” soon
discovers that the easiest way to answer an assertion
with a witticism is to concentrate one’s
mind on the opposite of this assertion and
trust to the chance flash of thought to brush
aside the feared objection to this opposite by
means of a different interpretation. Maybe
the representation through its opposite is indebted
for such a preference to the fact that
it forms the nucleus of another pleasurable
mode of mental expression, for an understanding
of which we do not have to consult the unconscious.
I refer to <em>irony</em>, which is very similar
to wit and is considered a subspecies of
the comic. The essence of irony consists in imparting
the very opposite of what one intended
to express, but it precludes the anticipated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>contradiction by indicating through the inflections,
concomitant gestures, and through slight
changes in style—if it is done in writing—that
the speaker himself means to convey the opposite
of what he says. Irony is applicable
only in cases where the other person is prepared
to hear the reverse of the statement
actually made, so that he cannot fail to be inclined
to contradict. As a consequence of this
condition ironic expressions are particularly
subject to the danger of being misunderstood.
To the person who uses it, it gives the advantage
of readily avoiding the difficulties to which
direct expressions, as, for example, invectives,
are subject. In the hearer it produces comic
pleasure, probably by causing him to make
preparations for contradiction, which are immediately
found to be unnecessary. Such a
comparison of wit with a form of the comical
that is closely allied to it might strengthen us
in the assumption that the relation of wit to
the unconscious is the peculiarity that also distinguishes
it from the comical.<a id='r62'></a><a href='#f62' class='c007'><sup>[62]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>In dream-work, representation through the
opposite has a far more important part to play
than in wit. The dream not only delights in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>representing a pair of opposites by means of
one and the same composite image, but in addition
it often changes an element from the
dream-thoughts into its opposite, thus causing
considerable difficulty in the work of interpretation.
In the case of any element capable of
having an opposite it is impossible to tell
whether it is to be taken negatively or positively
in the dream-thoughts.<a id='r63'></a><a href='#f63' class='c007'><sup>[63]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>I must emphasize that as yet this fact has
by no means been understood. Nevertheless,
it seems to give indications of an important
characteristic of unconscious thinking which in
all probability results in a process comparable
to “judging.” Instead of setting aside judgments
the unconscious forms “repressions.”
The repression may correctly be described as
a stage intermediate between the defense reflex
and condemnation.<a id='r64'></a><a href='#f64' class='c007'><sup>[64]</sup></a></p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>
  <h4 class='c016'><em>The Unconscious as the Psychic Stage of the Wit-work</em></h4>
</div>

<p class='c017'>Nonsense, or absurdity, which occurs so
often in dreams and which has made them the
object of so much contempt, has never really
come into being as the result of an accidental
shuffling of conceptual elements, but may in
every case be proven to have been purposely
admitted by the dream-work. Nonsense and
absurdity are intended to express embittered
criticism and scornful contradiction within the
dream-thoughts. Absurdity in the dream-content
thus stands for the judgment: “It’s pure
nonsense,” expressed in dream-thoughts. In
my work on the Interpretation of Dreams,
I have placed great emphasis on the demonstration
of this fact because I thought that I
could in this manner most strikingly controvert
the error expressed by many that the
dream is no psychic phenomenon at all—an
error which bars the way to an understanding
of the unconscious. Now we have learnt (in
the analysis of certain tendency-witticisms on
p. 73) that nonsense in wit is made to serve
the same purposes of expression. We also
know that a nonsensical façade of a witticism
is peculiarly adapted to enhance the psychic
expenditure in the hearer and hence also to increase
<span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>the amount to be discharged through
laughter. Moreover, we must not forget that
nonsense in wit is an end in itself, since the
purpose of reviving the old pleasure in nonsense
is one of the motives of the wit-work.
There are other ways to regain the feeling of
nonsense in order to derive pleasure from it;
caricature, exaggeration, parody, and travesty
utilize the same and thus produce “comical
nonsense.” If we subject these modes of expression
to an analysis similar to the one used
in studying wit, we shall find that there is no
occasion in any of them for resorting to unconscious
processes in our sense for the purpose
of getting explanations. We are now
also in a position to understand why the
“witty” character may be added as an embellishment
to caricature, exaggeration, and
parody; it is the manifold character of the performance
upon the “psychic stage”<a id='r65'></a><a href='#f65' class='c007'><sup>[65]</sup></a> that
makes this possible.</p>

<p class='c008'>I am of the opinion that by transferring the
wit-work into the system of the unconscious we
have made a distinct gain, since it makes it possible
for us to understand the fact that the
various techniques to which wit admittedly adheres
are on the other hand not its exclusive
<span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>property. Many doubts, which have arisen in
the beginning of our investigation of these
techniques and which we were forced temporarily
to leave, can now be conveniently cleared
up. Hence we shall give due consideration to
the doubt which expresses itself by asserting
that the undeniable relation of wit to the unconscious
is correct only for certain categories
of tendency-wit, while we are ready to claim
this relation for all forms and all the stages of
development of wit. We may not shirk the duty
of testing this objection.</p>

<p class='c008'>We may assume that we deal with a sure
case of wit-formation in the unconscious when
it concerns witticisms that serve unconscious
tendencies, or those strengthened by unconscious
tendencies, as, for example, most “cynical”
witticisms. For in such cases the unconscious
tendency draws the foreconscious
thought down into the unconscious in order to
remodel it there; a process to which the study
of the psychology of the neuroses has added
many analogies with which we are acquainted.
But in the case of tendency-wit of other varieties,
namely, harmless wit and the jest, this
power seems to fall away, and the relation of
the wit to the unconscious is an open question.</p>

<p class='c008'>But now let us consider the case of the witty
expression of a thought that is not without
<span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>value in itself and that comes to the surface in
the course of the association of mental
processes. In order that this thought may become
a witticism, it is of course necessary that
it make a choice among the possible forms of
expression in order to find the exact form that
will bring along the gain in word-pleasure.
We know from self-observation that this choice
is not made by conscious attention; but the
selection will certainly be better if the occupation
energy of the foreconscious thought is
lowered to the unconscious. For in the unconscious,
as we have learnt from the dream-work,
the paths of association emanating from a
word are treated on a par with associations
from objects. The occupation energy from
the unconscious presents by far the more favorable
conditions for the selection of the expression.
Moreover, we may assume without
going farther that the possible expression
which contains the gain in word-pleasure exerts
a lowering effect on the still fluctuating self-command
of the foreconscious, similar to that
exerted in the first case by the unconscious
tendency. As an explanation for the simpler
case of the jest we may imagine that an ever watchful
intention of attaining the gain in
word-pleasure seizes the opportunity offered
in the foreconscious of again drawing the investing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>energy down into the unconscious, according
to the familiar scheme.</p>

<p class='c008'>I earnestly wish that it were possible for me
on the one hand to present one decisive point
in my conception of wit more clearly, and on
the other hand to fortify it with compelling
arguments. But as a matter of fact it is not
a question here of two failures, but of one
and the same failure. I can give no clearer
exposition because I have no further testimony
on behalf of my conception. The latter has
developed as the result of my study of the
technique and of comparison with dream-work,
and indeed from this one side only. I now
find that the dream-work is altogether excellently
adapted to the peculiarities of wit. This
conception is now concluded; if the conclusion
leads us not to a familiar province, but rather
to one that is strange and novel to our modes
of thought, the conclusion is called a “hypothesis,”
and the relation of the hypothesis to
the material from which it is drawn is justly
not accepted as “proof.” The hypothesis is
admitted as “proved” only if it can be reached
by other ways and if it can be shown to be the
junction point for other associations. But
such proof, in view of the fact that our knowledge
of unconscious processes has hardly begun,
cannot be had. Realizing then that we are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>on soil still virgin, we shall be content to project
from our viewpoint of observation one narrow
slender plank into the unexplored region.</p>

<p class='c008'>We shall not build a great structure on such
a foundation as this. If we correlate the different
stages of wit to the mental dispositions
favorable to them we may say: The <em>jest</em> has
its origin in the happy mood; what seems to
be peculiar to it is an inclination to lower the
psychic static energies (<i><span lang="de">Besetzungen</span></i>). The
jest already makes use of all the characteristic
techniques of wit and satisfies the fundamental
conditions of the same through the choice of
such an assortment of words or mental associations
as will conform not only to the requirements
for the production of pleasure, but also
conform to the demands of the intelligent critic.
We shall conclude that the sinking of the mental
energy to the unconscious stage, a process
facilitated by the happy mood, has already
taken place in the case of the jest. The mood
does away with this requirement in the case of
<em>harmless</em> wit connected with the expression of
a valuable thought; here we must assume a
particular <em>personal adaptation</em> which finds it as
easy to come to expression as it is for the foreconscious
thought to sink for a moment into
the unconscious. An ever watchful tendency
to renew the original resultant pleasure of wit
<span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>exerts thereby a lowering effect upon the still
fluctuating foreconscious expression of the
thought. Most people are probably capable of
making jests when in a happy mood; aptitude
for joking independent of the mood is found
only in a few persons. Finally, the most powerful
incentive for wit-work is the presence of
strong tendencies which reach back into the unconscious
and which indicate a particular fitness
for witty productions; these tendencies
might explain to us why the subjective conditions
of wit are so frequently fulfilled in the
case of neurotic persons. Even the most inapt
person may become witty under the influence
of strong tendencies.</p>

<h4 class='c016'><em>Differences Between Wit and Dreams</em></h4>

<p class='c017'>This last contribution, the explanation of
wit-work in the first person, though still hypothetical,
strictly speaking, ends our interest
in wit. There still remains a short comparison
of wit to the more familiar dream and we may
expect that, outside of the one agreement already
considered, two such diverse mental activities
should show nothing but differences.
The most important difference lies in their social
behavior. The dream is a perfectly asocial
psychic product. It has nothing to tell to anyone
<span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>else, having originated in an individual as
a compromise between conflicting psychic
forces it remains incomprehensible to the person
himself and has therefore altogether no
interest for anybody else. Not only does the
dream find it unnecessary to place any value
on intelligibleness, but it must even guard
against being understood, as it would then be
destroyed; it can only exist in disguised form.
For this reason the dream may make use
freely of the mechanism that controls unconscious
thought processes to the extent of producing
undecipherable disfigurements. Wit, on
the other hand, is the most social of all those
psychic functions whose aim is to gain pleasure.
It often requires three persons, and the
psychic process which it incites always requires
the participation of at least one other person.
It must therefore bind itself to the condition
of intelligibleness; it may employ disfigurement
made practicable in the unconscious
through condensation and displacement, to no
greater extent than can be deciphered by the
intelligence of the third person. As for the
rest, wit and dreams have developed in altogether
different spheres of the psychic life, and
are to be classed under widely separated categories
of the psychological system. No matter
how concealed the dream is still a wish, while
<span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>wit is a developed play. Despite its apparent
unreality the dream retains its relation to the
great interests of life; it seeks to supply what
is lacking through a regressive detour of hallucinations;
and it owes its existence solely to
the strong need for sleep during the night.
Wit, on the other hand, seeks to draw a small
amount of pleasure from the free and unencumbered
activities of our psychic apparatus,
and later to seize this pleasure as an incidental
gain. It thus <em>secondarily</em> reaches to important
functions relative to the outer world. The
dream serves preponderately to guard from
pain while wit serves to acquire pleasure; in
these two aims all our psychic activities meet.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>
  <h3 class='c001'>VII<br> <span class='c015'>WIT AND THE VARIOUS FORMS OF THE COMIC</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c006'>We have approached the problems of the
comic in an unusual manner. It appeared to us
that wit, which is usually regarded as a subspecies
of the comic, offered enough peculiarities
to warrant our taking it directly under consideration,
and thus it came about that we avoided
discussing its relation to the more comprehensive
category of the comic as long as it was
possible to do so, yet we did not proceed without
picking up on the way some hints that
might be valuable for studying the comic. We
found it easy to ascertain that the comic differs
from wit in its social behavior. The comic can
be content with only two persons, one who
finds the comical, and one in whom it is found.
The third person to whom the comical may be
imparted reinforces the comic process, but adds
nothing new to it. In wit, however, this third
person is indispensable for the completion of
the pleasure-bearing process, while the second
person may be omitted, especially when it is
not a question of aggressive wit with a tendency.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>Wit is made, while the comical is found;
it is found first of all in persons, and only
later by transference may be seen also in objects,
situations, and the like. We know, too,
in the case of wit that it is not strange persons,
but one’s own mental processes that contain
the sources for the production of pleasure.
In addition we have heard that wit occasionally
reopens inaccessible sources of the
comic, and that the comic often serves wit as
a façade to replace the fore-pleasure usually
produced by the well-known technique (p.
236). All of this does not really point to a
very simple relationship between wit and the
comic. On the other hand, the problems of the
comic have shown themselves to be so complicated,
and have until now so successfully defied
all attempts made by the philosophers to
solve them, that we have not been able to
justify the expectation of mastering it by a
sudden stroke, so to speak, even if we approach
it along the paths of wit. Incidentally we
came provided with an instrument for investigating
wit that had not yet been made use of
by others; namely, the knowledge of dream-work.
We have no similar advantage at our
disposal for comprehending the comic, and we
may therefore expect that we shall learn nothing
about the nature of the comic other than
<span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>that which we have already become aware of
in wit; in so far as wit belongs to the comic
and retains certain features of the same unchanged
or modified in its own nature.</p>

<h4 class='c016'><em>The Naïve</em></h4>

<p class='c017'>The species of the comic that is most closely
allied to wit is the <em>naïve</em>. Like the comic the
naïve is found universally and is not made like
in the case of wit. The naïve cannot be made
at all, while in the case of the pure comic the
question of making or evoking the comical may
be taken into account. The naïve must result
without our intervention from the speech
and actions of other persons who take the place
of the <em>second</em> person in the comic or in wit.
The naïve originates when one puts himself
completely outside of inhibition, because it
does not exist for him; that is, if he seems to
overcome it without any effort. What conditions
the function of the naïve is the fact that
we are aware that the person does not possess
this inhibition, otherwise we should not call it
naïve but impudent, and instead of laughing
we should be indignant. The effect of the
naïve, which is irresistible, seems easy to understand.
An expenditure of that inhibition energy
which is commonly already formed in us
<span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span>suddenly becomes inapplicable when we hear
the naïve and is discharged through laughter;
as the removal of the inhibition is direct, and
not the result of an incited operation, there is
no need for a suspension of attention. We behave
like the hearer in wit, to whom the economy
of inhibition is given without any effort
on his part.</p>

<p class='c008'>In view of the understanding about the
genesis of inhibitions which we obtained while
tracing the development of play into wit, it
will not surprise us to learn that the naïve is
mostly found in children, although it may also
be observed in uneducated adults, whom we
look on as children as far as their intellectual
development is concerned. For the purposes
of comparison with wit, naïve speech is naturally
better adapted than naïve actions, for
speech and not actions are the usual forms of
expression employed by wit. It is significant,
however, that naïve speeches, such as those of
children, can without straining also be designated
as “naïve witticisms.” The points of
agreement as well as demonstration between
wit and naïveté will become clear to us upon
consideration of a few examples.<a id='r66'></a><a href='#f66' class='c007'><sup>[66]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'><em>A little girl of three years was accustomed
to hear from her German nurse the exclamatory
<span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>word “Gesundheit” (God bless you!; literally,
may you be healthy!) whenever she happened
to sneeze. While suffering from a severe
cold during which the profuse coughing
and sneezing caused her considerable pain, she
pointed to her chest and said to her father,
“Daddy, Gesundheit hurts.”</em></p>

<p class='c008'><em>Another little girl of four years heard her
parents refer to a Jewish acquaintance as a
Hebrew, and on later hearing the latter’s wife
referred to as Mrs. X, she corrected her
mother, saying, “No, that is not her name; if
her husband is a Hebrew she is a Shebrew.”</em></p>

<p class='c008'>In the first example the wit is produced
through the use of a contiguous association in
the form of an abstract thought for the concrete
action. The child so often heard the
word “Gesundheit” associated with sneezing
that she took it for the act itself. While the
second example may be designated as word-wit
formed by the technique of sound similarity.
The child divided the word Hebrew into
He-brew and having been taught the genders
of the personal pronouns, she naturally
imagined that if the man is a He-brew his wife
must be a She-brew. Both examples could
have originated as real witticisms upon which
we would have unwillingly bestowed a little
mild laughter. But as examples of naïveté
<span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>they seem excellent and cause loud laughter.
But what is it here that produces the difference
between wit and naïveté? Apparently it is
neither the wording nor the technique, which is
the same for both wit and the naïve, but a factor
which at first sight seems remote from both.
It is simply a question whether we assume that
the speakers had the intention of making a witticism
or whether we assume that they—the
children—wished to draw an earnest conclusion,
a conclusion held in good faith though based
on uncorrected knowledge. Only the latter
case is one of naïveté. It is here that our attention
is first called to the mechanism in which
the second person places himself into the psychic
process of the person who produces the
wit.</p>

<p class='c008'>The investigation of a third example will
confirm this opinion. A brother and a sister,
the former ten and the latter twelve years old,
produce a play of their own composition before
an audience of uncles and aunts. The scene
represents a hut on the seashore. In the first
act the two dramatist-actors, a poor fisherman
and his devoted wife, complain about the hard
times and the difficulty of getting a livelihood.
The man decides to sail over the wide ocean
in his boat in order to seek wealth elsewhere,
and after a touching farewell the curtain is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>drawn. The second act takes place several
years later. The fisherman has come home
rich with a big bag of money and tells his wife,
whom he finds waiting in front of the hut,
what good luck he has had in the far countries.
His wife interrupts him proudly, saying: “Nor
have I been idle in the meanwhile,” and opens
the hut, on whose floor the fisherman sees
twelve large dolls representing children asleep.
At this point of the drama the performers
were interrupted by an outburst of laughter
on the part of the audience, a thing which they
could not understand. They stared dumfounded
at their dear relatives, who had thus
far behaved respectably and had listened attentively.
The explanation of this laughter
lies in the assumption on the part of the audience
that the young dramatists know nothing
as yet about the origin of children, and were
therefore in a position to believe that a wife
would actually boast of bearing offspring
during the prolonged absence of her husband,
and that the husband would rejoice with her
over it. But the results achieved by the dramatists
on the basis of this ignorance may be
designated as nonsense or absurdity.</p>

<p class='c008'>These examples show that the naïve occupies
a position midway between wit and the
comic. As far as wording and contents are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>concerned, the naïve speech is identical with
wit; it produces a misuse of words, a bit of
nonsense, or an obscenity. But the psychic
process of the first person or producer which,
in the case of wit, offered us so much that was
interesting and puzzling, is here entirely absent.
The naïve person imagines that he is
using his thoughts and expressions in a simple
and normal manner; he has no other purpose
in view, and receives no pleasure from his
naïve production. All the characteristics of
the naïve lie in the conception of the hearer,
who corresponds to the third person in the case
of wit. The producing person creates the
naïve without any effort. The complicated
technique, which in wit serves to paralyze the
inhibition produced by the critical reason, does
not exist here, because the person does not possess
this inhibition, and he can therefore readily
produce the senseless and the obscene without
any compromise. The naïve may be added
to the realm of wit if it comes into existence
after the important function of the censor, as
observed in the formula for wit-formation, has
been reduced to zero.</p>

<p class='c008'>If the affective determination of wit consists
in the fact that both persons should be
subject to about the same inhibitions or inner
resistances, we may say now that the determination
<span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>of the naïve consists in the fact that one
person should have inhibitions which the other
lacks. It is the person provided with inhibitions
who understands the naïve, and it is he
alone who gains the pleasure produced by the
naïve. We can easily understand that this
pleasure is due to the removal of inhibitions.
Since the pleasure of wit is of the same origin—a
kernel of word-pleasure and nonsense-pleasure,
and a shell of removal- and release-pleasure,—the
similarity of this connection to
the inhibition thus determines the inner relationship
between the naïve and wit. In both
cases pleasure results from the removal of inner
inhibitions. But the psychic process of the
recipient person (which in the naïve regularly
corresponds with our ego, whereas in wit we
may also put ourselves in place of the producing
person) is by as much more complicated in
the case of the naïve as it is simpler in the producing
person in wit. For one thing, the
naïve must produce the same effect upon the
receiving person as wit does, this may be fully
confirmed by our examples, for just as in wit
the removal of the censor has been made possible
by the mere effort of hearing the naïve.
But only a part of the pleasure created by the
naïve admits of this explanation, in other cases
of naïve utterances, even this portion would be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>endangered, as, for example, while listening to
naïve obscenities. We would react to a naïve
obscenity with the same indignation felt toward
a real obscenity, were it not for the fact
that another factor saves us from this indignation
and at the same time furnishes the more
important part of the pleasure derived from
the naïve.</p>

<p class='c008'>This other factor is the result of the condition
mentioned before, namely, that in order to
recognize the naïve we have to be cognizant of
the fact that there are no inner inhibitions in
the producing person. It is only when this is
assured that we laugh instead of being indignant.
Hence we take into consideration the
psychic state of the producing person; we
imagine ourselves in this same psychic state
and endeavor to understand it by comparing
it to our own. This putting ourselves into the
psychic state of the producing person and comparing
it with our own results in an economy
of expenditure which we discharge through
laughing.</p>

<p class='c008'>We might prefer the simpler explanation,
namely, that when we reflect that the person
has no inhibition to overcome our indignation
becomes superfluous; the laughing therefore
results at the cost of economized indignation.
In order to avoid this conception, which is, in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>general, misleading, I shall distinguish more
sharply between two cases that I had treated
as one in the above discussion. The naïve, as
it appears to us, may either be in the nature
of a witticism, as in our example, or an obscenity,
or of anything generally objectionable;
which becomes especially evident if the naïve
is expressed not in speech but in action.
This latter case is really misleading; for
it might lead one to assume that the pleasure
originated from the economized and transformed
indignation. The first case is the illuminating
one. The naïve speech in the example
“Hebrew” can produce the effect of a
light witticism and give no cause for indignation;
it is certainly the more rare, or the more
pure and by far the more instructive case. In
so far as we think that the child took the syllable
“he” in “Hebrew” seriously, and without
any additional reason identified it with the
masculine personal pronoun, the increase in
pleasure as a result of hearing it has no longer
anything to do with the pleasure of the wit.
We shall now consider what has been said
from two viewpoints, first how it came into
existence in the mind of the child, and secondly,
how it would occur to us. In following
this comparison we find that the child has
discovered an identity and has overcome barriers
<span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span>which exist in us, and by continuing still
further it may express itself as follows: “If
you wish to understand what you have heard,
you may save yourself the expenditure necessary
for holding these barriers in place.” The
expenditure which became freed by this comparison
is the source of pleasure in the naïve,
and is discharged through laughter; to be sure,
it is the same expenditure which we would
have converted into indignation if our understanding
of the producing person, and in this
case the nature of his utterance, had not precluded
it. But if we take the case of the naïve
joke as a model for the second case, viz., the
objectionable naïve, we shall see that here, too,
the economy in inhibition may originate directly
from the comparison. That is, it is unnecessary
for us to assume an incipient and
then a strangulated indignation, an indignation
corresponding to a different application of
the freed expenditure, against which, in the
case of wit, complicated defensive mechanisms
were required.</p>

<h4 class='c016'><em>Source of Comic Pleasure in the Naïve</em></h4>

<p class='c017'>This comparison and this economy of expenditure
that occur as the result of putting
one’s self into the psychic process of the producing
person can have an important bearing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_300'>300</span>on the naïve only if they do not belong to the
naïve alone. As a matter of fact we suspect
that this mechanism which is so completely
foreign to wit is a part—perhaps the essential
part—of the psychic process of the comic.
This aspect—it is perhaps the most important
aspect of the naïve—thus represents
the naïve as a form of the comic.
Whatever is added to the wit-pleasure by the
naïve speeches in our examples is “comical”
pleasure. Concerning the latter we might be
inclined to make a general assumption that
this pleasure originates through an economized
expenditure by comparing the utterance of
some one else with our own. But since we are
here in the presence of very broad views we
shall first conclude our consideration of the
naïve. The naïve would thus be a form of the
comic, in so far as its pleasure originates from
the difference in expenditure which results in
our effort to understand the other person; and
it resembles wit through the condition that the
expenditure saved by the comparison must be
an inhibition expenditure.<a id='r67'></a><a href='#f67' class='c007'><sup>[67]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span>Before concluding we shall rapidly point out
a few agreements and differences between the
conceptions at which we have just arrived and
those that have been known for a long time
in the psychology of the comic. The putting
one’s self into the psychic process of another
and the desire to understand him is obviously
nothing else than the “comic burrowing”
(<i><span lang="de">komisches Leihen</span></i>) which has played a part
in the analysis of the comic ever since the time
of Jean Paul; the “comparing” of the psychic
process of another with our own corresponds
to a “psychological contrast,” for which we here
at last find a place, after we did not know
what to do with it in wit. But in our explanation
of comic pleasure we take issue with
many authors who contend that this pleasure
originates through the fluctuation of our attention
to and fro between contrasting ideas.
We are unable to see how such a mechanism
could produce pleasure, and we point to the
fact that in the comparing of contrasts there
results a difference in expenditure which, if
not used for anything else, becomes capable of
discharge and hence a source of pleasure.<a id='r68'></a><a href='#f68' class='c007'><sup>[68]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>It is with misgiving only that we approach
the problem of the comic. It would be presumptuous
to expect from our efforts any decisive
contribution to the solution of this problem
after the works of a large number of excellent
thinkers have not resulted in an explanation
that is in every respect satisfactory. As a matter
of fact, we intend simply to follow out into
the province of the comic certain observations
that have been found valuable in the study of wit.</p>

<h4 class='c016'><em>Occurrence and Origin of the Comic</em></h4>

<p class='c017'>The comical appears primarily as an unintentional
discovery in the social relations of
human beings. It is found in persons, that is,
in their movements, shapes, actions, and characteristic
traits. In the beginning it is found
probably only in their psychical peculiarities
and later on in their mental qualities, especially
in the expression of these latter. Even animals
and inanimate objects become comical as the
result of a widely used method of personification.
However, the comical can be considered
apart from the person in whom it is found, if
the conditions under which a person becomes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_303'>303</span>comical can be discerned. Thus arises the comical
situation, and this knowledge enables us
to make a person comical at will by putting
him into situations in which the conditions necessary
for the comic are bound up with his actions.
The discovery that it is in our power to
make another person comical opens the way to
unsuspected gains in comic pleasure, and forms
the foundation of a highly developed technique.
It is also possible to make one’s self
just as comical as others. The means which
serve to make a person comical are transference
into comic situations, imitations, disguise,
unmasking, caricature, parody, travesty,
and the like. It is quite evident that these
techniques may enter into the service of hostile
or aggressive tendencies. A person may be
made comical in order to render him contemptible
or in order to deprive him of his claims
to dignity and authority. But even if such a
purpose were regularly at the bottom of all attempts
to make a person comical this need not
necessarily be the meaning of the spontaneous
comic.</p>

<p class='c008'>As a result of this superficial survey of the
manifestations of the comic we can readily see
that the comic originates from wide-spread
sources, and that conditions so specialized as
those found in the naïve cannot be expected
<span class='pageno' id='Page_304'>304</span>in the case of the comic. In order to get a
clue to the conditions that are applicable to
the comic the selection of the first example is
most important. We will examine first the
comic movement because we remember that
the most primitive stage performance, the
pantomime, uses this means to make us laugh.
The answer to the question, Why do we laugh
at the actions of clowns? would be that they
appear to us immoderate and inappropriate;
that is, we really laugh over the excessive expenditure
of energy. Let us look for the
same condition outside of the manufactured
comic, that is, under circumstances where it
may unintentionally be found. The child’s
motions do not appear to us comical, even if it
jumps and fidgets, but it is comical to see a
little boy or girl follow with the tongue the
movement of his pen-holder when he is trying
to master the art of writing; we see in these
additional motions a superfluous expenditure
of energy which under similar conditions we
should save. In the same way we find it comical
to see unnecessary motions or even
marked exaggeration of expressive motions in
adults. Among the genuinely comic cases we
might mention the motions made by the bowler
after he has released the ball while he is following
its course as though he were still able
<span class='pageno' id='Page_305'>305</span>to control it; all grimaces which exaggerate
the normal expression of the emotions are comical,
even if they are involuntary, as in the
case of persons suffering from St. Vitus’
dance (chorea); the impassioned movements
of a modern orchestra leader will appear comical
to every unmusical person, who cannot
understand why they are necessary. Indeed,
the comic element found in bodily shapes and
physiognomy is a branch of the comic of motion,
in that they are conceived as though they were
the result of motion that either has been carried
too far or is purposeless. Wide exposed eyes,
a crook-shaped nose bent towards the mouth,
handle-like ears, a hunch back, and all similar
physical defects probably produce a comical
impression only in so far as the movements
that would be necessary to produce these
features are imagined, whereby the nose and
other parts of the body are pictured as more
movable than they actually are. It is certainly
comical if some one can “wiggle his
ears,” and it would undoubtedly be a great
deal more comical if he could raise and lower
his nose. A large part of the comical impression
that animals make upon us is due to the fact that
we perceive in them movements which we cannot
imitate.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_306'>306</span>
  <h4 class='c016'><em>Comic of Motion</em></h4>
</div>

<p class='c017'>But how does it come about that we laugh
as soon as we have recognized that the actions
of some one else are immoderate and inappropriate?
I believe that we laugh because we
compare the motions observed in others with
those which we ourselves should produce if we
were in their place. The two persons must
naturally be compared in accordance with the
same standard, but this standard is my own
innervation expenditure connected with my
idea of motion in the one case as well as the
other. This assertion is in need of discussion
and amplification.</p>

<p class='c008'>What we are here putting into juxtaposition
is, on the one hand, the psychic expenditure of
a given idea, and on the other hand, the content
of this idea. We maintain that the
former is not primarily and principally independent
of the latter—the content of the
idea—particularly because the idea of something
great requires a larger expenditure
than the idea of something small. As long as
we are concerned only with the idea of different
coarse movements we shall encounter no
difficulties in the theoretical determination of
our thesis or in establishing its proof through
observation. It will be shown that in this case
<span class='pageno' id='Page_307'>307</span>an attribute of the idea actually coincides with
an attribute of the object conceived, although
psychology warns us of confusions of this sort.</p>

<p class='c008'>I obtain an idea of a definite coarse movement
by performing this motion or by imitating
it, and in so doing I set a standard for
this motion in my feelings of innervation.<a id='r69'></a><a href='#f69' class='c007'><sup>[69]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>Now if I perceive a similar more or less
coarse motion in some one else, the surest way
to the understanding—to apperception—of the
same is to carry it out imitatively and the comparison
will then enable me to decide in which
motion I expended more energy. Such an impulse
to imitate certainly arises on perceiving
a movement. But in reality I do not carry
out the imitation any more than I still spell
out words simply because I have learnt to read
by means of spelling. Instead of imitating the
movement by my muscles I substitute the idea
of the same through my memory traces of the
expenditures necessary for similar motions.
Perceiving, or “thinking,” differs above all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_308'>308</span>from acting or carrying out things by the fact
that it entails a very much smaller displacement
of energy and keeps the main expenditure
from being discharged. But how is the
quantitative factor, the more or less big element
of the movement perceived, given expression
in the idea? And if the representation
of the quantity is left off from the idea that
is composed of qualities, how am I to differentiate
the ideas of different big movements,
how am I to compare them?</p>

<p class='c008'>Here, physiology shows the way in that it
teaches us that even while an idea is in the
process of conception innervations proceed to
the muscles, which naturally represent only a
moderate expenditure. It is now easy to assume
that this expenditure of innervation
which accompanies the conception of the idea
is utilized to represent the quantitative factor
of the idea, and that when a great motion is
imagined it is greater than it would be in the
case of a small one. The conception of greater
motions would thus actually be greater, that
is, it would be a conception accompanied by
greater expenditure.</p>

<h4 class='c016'><em>Ideational Mimicry</em></h4>

<p class='c017'>Observation shows directly that human beings
are in the habit of expressing the big and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_309'>309</span>small things in their ideation content by means
of a manifold expenditure or by means of a
sort of <em>ideational mimicry</em>.</p>

<p class='c008'>When a child or a person of the common
people or one belonging to a certain race imparts
or depicts something, one can easily observe
that he is not content to make his ideas
intelligible to the hearer through the choice of
correct words alone, but that he also represents
the contents of the same through his expressive
motions. Thus he designates the
quantities and intensities of “a high mountain”
by raising his hands over his head, and
those of “a little dwarf” by lowering his
hand to the ground. If he broke himself of
the habit of depicting with his hands, he would
nevertheless do it with his voice, and if he
should also control his voice, one may be sure
that in picturing something big he would distend
his eyes, and describing something little
he would press his eyes together. It is not his
own affects that he thus expresses, but it is
really the content of what he imagines.</p>

<p class='c008'>Shall we now assume that this need for
mimicry is first aroused through the demand
for imparting, whereas a good part of this
manner of representation still escapes the attention
of the hearer? I rather believe that this
mimicry, though less vivid, exists even if all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_310'>310</span>imparting is left out of the question, that it
comes about when the person imagines for
himself alone, or thinks of something in a
graphic manner; that then such a person, just
as in talking, expresses through his body the
idea of big and small which manifests itself at
least through a change of innervation in the
facial expressions and sensory organs. Indeed,
I can imagine that the bodily innervation
which is consensual to the content of the idea
conceived is the beginning and origin of mimicry
for purposes of communication. For, in
order to be in a position to serve this purpose,
it is only necessary to increase it and make it
conspicuous to the other. When I take the
view that this “expression of the ideation content”
should be added to the expression of the
emotions, which are known as a physical by-effect
of psychic processes, I am well aware
that my observations which refer to the category
of the big and small do not exhaust
the subject. I myself could add still other
things, even before reaching to the phenomenon
of tension through which a person
physically indicates the accumulation of his attention
and the <i><span lang="fr">niveau</span></i> of abstraction upon
which his thoughts happen to rest. I maintain
that this subject is very important, and I believe
that tracing the ideation mimicry in other
<span class='pageno' id='Page_311'>311</span>fields of æsthetics would be just as useful for
the understanding of the comic as it is here.</p>

<p class='c008'>To return to the comic movement, I repeat
that with the perception of a certain motion
the impulse to conceive it will be given through
a certain expenditure. In the “desire to
understand,” in the apperception of this movement
I produce a certain expenditure, and I
behave in this part of the psychic process just
as if I put myself in the place of the person
observed. Simultaneously I probably grasp
the aim of the motion, and through former experiences
I am able to estimate the amount of
expenditure necessary to attain this aim. I
thereby drop out of consideration the person
observed and behave as if I myself wished to
attain the aim of the motion. These two ideational
possibilities depend on a comparison of
the motion observed with my own inhibited
motion. In the case of an immoderate or inappropriate
movement on the part of the other,
my greater expenditure for understanding becomes
inhibited <i><span lang="la">statu nascendi</span></i> during the mobilization
as it were, it is declared superfluous
and stands free for further use or for discharge
through laughing. If other favorable
conditions supervened this would be the nature
of the origin of pleasure in comic movement,—an
innervation expenditure which,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_312'>312</span>when compared with one’s own motion, becomes
an inapplicable surplus.</p>

<h4 class='c016'><em>Comparison of Two Kinds of Expenditure as Pleasure-sources</em></h4>

<p class='c017'>We now note that we must continue our
discussion by following two different paths;
first, to determine the conditions for the discharge
of the surplus; secondly, to test
whether the other cases of the comic can be
conceived similarly to our conception of comic
motion.</p>

<p class='c008'>We shall turn first to the latter task and
after considering comic movement and action
we shall turn to the comic found in the psychic
activities and peculiarities of others.</p>

<p class='c008'>As an example of this kind we may consider
the comical nonsense produced by ignorant
students at examinations; it is more difficult,
however, to give a simple example of
the peculiarities. We must not be confused
by the fact that nonsense and foolishness which
so often act in a comical manner are nevertheless
not perceived as comical in all cases, just
as the same things which once made us laugh
because they seemed comical later may appear
to us contemptible and hateful. This fact,
which we must not forget to take into account,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_313'>313</span>seems only to show that besides the comparison
familiar to us other relations come into consideration
for the comic effect,—conditions
which we can investigate in other connections.</p>

<p class='c008'>The comic found in the mental and psychic
attributes of another person is apparently
again the result of a comparison between him
and my own ego. But it is remarkable that it
is a comparison which mostly furnishes the
result opposite to that obtained through comic
movement and action. In the latter case it is
comical if the other person assumes a greater
expenditure than I believe to be necessary for
me; in the case of psychic activity it is just
the reverse, it is comical if the other person
economizes in expenditure, which I consider
indispensable; for nonsense and foolishness are
nothing but inferior activities. In the first
case I laugh because he makes it too difficult
for himself, and in the latter case because he
makes it too easy for himself. In the case of
the comic effect it seems to be a question only
of the difference between the two energy expenditures—the
one of “feeling one’s self into
something” (<i><span lang="de">Einfühlung</span></i>)—and the other of
the ego—and it makes no difference in whose
favor this difference inclines. This peculiarity,
which at first confuses our judgment, disappears,
however, when we consider that it is in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_314'>314</span>accord with our personal development towards
a higher stage of culture, to limit our muscular
work and increase our mental work. By
heightening our mental expenditure we produce
a diminution of motion expenditure for
the same activity. Our machines bear witness
to this cultural success.<a id='r70'></a><a href='#f70' class='c007'><sup>[70]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>Thus it coincides with a uniform understanding
that that person appears comical to us who
puts forth too much expenditure in his psychical
activities and too little in his mental activities;
and it cannot be denied that in both cases our
laughing is the expression of a pleasurably
perceived superiority which we adjudge to
ourselves in comparison with him. If the relation
in both cases becomes reversed, that is,
if the somatic expenditure of the other is less
and the psychic expenditure greater, then we
no longer laugh, but are struck with amazement
and admiration.<a id='r71'></a><a href='#f71' class='c007'><sup>[71]</sup></a></p>

<h4 class='c016'><em>Comic of Situation.</em></h4>

<p class='c017'>The origin of the comic pleasure discussed here,
that is, the origin of such pleasure in a comparison
<span class='pageno' id='Page_315'>315</span>of the other person with one’s own self
in respect to the difference between the identification
expenditure (<i><span lang="de">Einfühlungsaufwand</span></i>)
and normal expenditure—is genetically probably
the most important. It is certain, however,
that it is not the only one. We have learned
before to disregard any such comparison between
the other person and one’s self, and to
obtain the pleasure-bringing difference from
one side only, either from identification, or
from the processes in one’s own ego, proving
thereby that the feeling of superiority bears
no essential relations to comic pleasure. A
comparison is indispensable, however, for the
origin of this pleasure, and we find this comparison
between two energy expenditures
which rapidly follow each other and refer to
the same function. It is produced either in
ourselves by way of identification with the
other, or we find it without any identification
in our own psychic processes. The first case,
in which the other person still plays a part,
though he is not compared with ourselves, results
when the pleasure-producing difference
of energy expenditures comes into existence
through outer influences which we can comprehend
as a “situation,” for which reason this
species of comic is also called the “comic of
situation.” The peculiarities of the person who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_316'>316</span>furnishes the comic do not here come into essential
consideration; we laugh when we admit
to ourselves that had we been placed in the
same situation we should have done the same
thing. Here we draw the comic from the relation
of the individual to the often all-too-powerful
outer world, which is represented in
the psychic processes of the individual by the
conventions and necessities of society, and even
by his bodily needs. A typical example of the
latter is when a person engaged in an activity,
which claims all his psychic forces, is suddenly
disturbed by a pain or excremental need. The
opposite case which furnishes us the comic
difference through identification, lies between
the great interest which existed before the
disturbance occurred and the minimum left
for his psychic activity after the disturbance
made its appearance. The person who
furnishes us this difference again becomes
comical through inferiority; but he is only inferior
in comparison with his former ego and
not in comparison with us, for we know that
in a similar case we could not have behaved
differently. It is remarkable, however, that
we find this inferiority of the person only in
the case where we “feel ourselves” into some
one, that is, we can only find it comical in the
other, whereas we ourselves are conscious only
<span class='pageno' id='Page_317'>317</span>of painful emotions when such or similar embarrassments
happen to us. It is by keeping
away the painful from our own person that we
are probably first enabled to enjoy as pleasurable
the difference which resulted from the
comparison of the changing energy.</p>

<h4 class='c016'><em>Comic of Expectation</em></h4>

<p class='c017'>The other source of the comic, which we find
in our own changes of investing energy, lies
in our relations to the future, which we are
accustomed to anticipate through our ideas of
expectation. I assume that a quantitatively
determined expenditure underlies our every
idea of expectation, which in case of disappointment
becomes diminished by a certain difference,
and I again refer to the observations
made before concerning “ideational mimicry.”
But it seems to me easier to demonstrate
the real mobilized psychic expenditure for the
cases of expectation. It is well known concerning
a whole series of cases that the manifestation
of expectation is formed by motor
preliminaries; this is first of all true of cases
in which the expected events make demands
on my motility, and these preparations are
quantitatively determinable without anything
further. If I am expecting to catch a ball
<span class='pageno' id='Page_318'>318</span>thrown at me, I put my body in states of tension
in order to enable me to withstand the
collision with the ball, and the superfluous motions
which I make if the ball turns out to be
light make me look comical to the spectators.
I allowed myself to be misled by the expectation
to exert an immoderate expenditure of
motion. A similar thing happens if, for example,
I lift out a basket of fruit which I took
to be heavy but which was hollow and formed
out of wax in order to deceive me. By its upward
jerk my arm betrays the fact that I have
prepared a superfluous innervation for this
purpose and hence I am laughed at. In fact
there is at least one case in which the expectation
expenditure can be directly demonstrated
by means of physiological experimentation with
animals. In Pawlof’s experiments with salivary
secretions of dogs who, provided with salivary
fistulæ, are shown different kinds of food,
it is noticed that the amount of saliva secreted
through the fistulæ depends on whether the
conditions of the experiment have strengthened
or disappointed the dogs’ expectation to be
fed with the food shown them.</p>

<p class='c008'>Even where the thing expected lays claims
only to my sensory organs, and not to my motility,
I may assume that the expectation manifests
itself in a certain motor emanation causing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_319'>319</span>tension of the senses, and I may even conceive
the suspension of attention as a motor
activity which is equivalent to a certain amount
of expenditure. Moreover, I can presuppose
that the preparatory activity of expectation
is not independent of the amount of the expected
impression, but that I represent mimically
the bigness and smallness of the same
by means of a greater or smaller preparatory
expenditure, just as in the case of imparting
something and in the case of thinking when
there is no expectation. The expectation expenditure
naturally will be composed of many
components, and also for my disappointment
diverse factors will come into consideration; it
is not only a question whether the realized
event is perceptibly greater or smaller than the
expected one, but also whether the expectation
is worthy of the great interest which I had offered
for it. In this manner I am instructed
to consider, besides the expenditure for the
representation of bigness and smallness (the
conceptual mimicry), also the expenditure for
the tension of attention (expectation expenditure),
and in addition to these two expenditures
there is in all cases the abstraction expenditure.
But these other forms of expenditure
can easily be reduced to the one of bigness
and smallness, for what we call more interesting,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_320'>320</span>more sublime, and even more abstract,
are only particularly qualified special
cases of what is greater. Let us add to this
that, among other things, Lipps holds that the
quantitative, not the qualitative, contrast is
primarily the source of comic pleasure, and we
shall be altogether content to have chosen the
comic element of motion as the starting-point
of our investigation.</p>

<p class='c008'>In working out Kant’s thesis, “The comic
is an expectation dwindled into nothing,”
Lipps made the attempt in his book, often
cited here, to trace the comic pleasure altogether
to expectation. Despite the many instructive
and valuable results which this attempt
brought to light I should like to agree
with the criticism expressed by other authors,
namely, that Lipps has formulated a field of
origin of the comic which is much too narrow,
and that he could not subject its phenomena
to his formula without much forcing.</p>

<h4 class='c016'><em>Caricature</em></h4>

<p class='c017'>Human beings are not satisfied with enjoying
the comic as they encounter it in life, but
they aim to produce it purposely, thus we discover
more of the nature of the comic by
studying the methods employed in producing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_321'>321</span>the comic. Above all one can produce comical
elements in one’s personality for the amusement
of others, by making one’s self appear
awkward or stupid. One then produces the
comic exactly as if one were really so, by complying
with the condition of comparison which
leads to the difference of expenditure; but one
does not make himself laughable or contemptible
through this; indeed, under certain circumstances
one can even secure admiration. The
feeling of superiority does not come into existence
in the other when he knows that the actor
is only shamming, and this furnishes us a good
new proof that the comic is independent in
principle of the feeling of superiority.</p>

<p class='c008'>To make another comical, the method most
commonly employed is to transfer him into
situations wherein he becomes comical regardless
of his personal qualities, as a result of human
dependence upon external circumstances,
especially social factors; in other words, one
resorts to the comical situation. This transferring
into a comic situation may be real as
in practical jokes, such as placing the foot in
front of one so that he falls like a clumsy person,
or making one appear stupid by utilizing
his credulity to make him believe some nonsense,
etc., or it can be feigned by means of
speech or play. It is a good aid in aggression,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_322'>322</span>in the service of which production of the
comic is wont to place itself in order that the
comic pleasure may be independent of the
reality of the comic situation; thus every person
is really defenseless against being made
comical.</p>

<p class='c008'>But there are still other means of making
one comical which deserve special attention
and which in part also show new sources of
comic pleasure. <em>Imitation</em>, for example, belongs
here; it accords the hearer an extraordinary
amount of pleasure and makes its
subject comic, even if it still keeps away from
the exaggeration of caricature. It is much
easier to fathom the comic effect of caricature
than that of simple imitation. Caricature,
parody and travesty, like their practical
counterpart—unmasking, range themselves
against persons and objects who command
authority and respect and who are exalted in
some sense—these are procedures tending towards
degradation.<a id='r72'></a><a href='#f72' class='c007'><sup>[72]</sup></a> In the transferred psychic
sense, the exalted is equivalent to something
great and I want to make the statement,
or more accurately to repeat the statement,
that psychic greatness like somatic greatness
<span class='pageno' id='Page_323'>323</span>is exhibited by means of an increased expenditure.
It needs little observation to ascertain
that when I speak of the exalted I give a different
innervation to my voice, I change my
facial expression, an attempt to bring my entire
bearing as it were into complete accord
with the dignity of that which I present. I
impose upon myself a dignified restriction not
much different than if I were coming into the
presence of an illustrious personage, monarch,
or prince of science. I can scarcely err when
I assume that this added innervation of conceptual
mimicry corresponds to an increased
expenditure. The third case of such an added
expenditure I readily find when I indulge in
abstract trains of thought instead of in the
concrete and plastic ideas. If I can now
imagine that the mentioned processes for degrading
the illustrious are quite ordinary, that
during their activity I need not be on my
guard and in whose ideal presence I may, to
use a military formula, put myself “at ease,”
all that saves me the added expenditure of
dignified restriction. Moreover, the comparison
of this manner of presentation instigated
by identification with the manner of presentation
to which I have been hitherto accustomed
which seeks to present itself at the
same time, again produces a difference in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_324'>324</span>expenditure which can be discharged through
laughter.</p>

<p class='c008'>As is known, caricature brings about the
degradation by rendering prominent one feature,
comic in itself, from the entire picture of
the exalted object, a feature which would be
overlooked if viewed with the entire picture.
Only by isolating this feature can the comic
effect be obtained which spreads in our memory
over the whole picture. This has, however,
this condition; the presence of the exalted
itself must not force us into a disposition of
reverence. Where such a comical feature is
really lacking then caricature unhesitatingly
creates it by exaggerating one that is not comical
in itself. It is again characteristic of the
origin of comic pleasure that the effect of the
caricature is not essentially impaired through
such a falsifying of reality.</p>

<h4 class='c016'><em>Unmasking</em></h4>

<p class='c017'><em>Parody</em> and <em>travesty</em> accomplish the degradation
of the exalted by other means; they
destroy the uniformity between the attributes
of persons familiar to us and their speech and
actions; by replacing either the illustrious persons
or their utterances by lowly ones.
Therein they differ from caricature, but not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_325'>325</span>through the mechanism of the production of
the comic pleasure. The same mechanism also
holds true in <em>unmasking</em>, which comes into
consideration only where some one has attached
to himself dignity and authority which in
reality should be taken from him. We have
seen the comic effect of unmasking through
several examples of wit, for example, in the
story of the fashionable lady who in her first
labor-pains cries: “Ah, mon Dieu!” but to
whom the physician paid no attention until she
screamed: “A-a-a-ai-e-e-e-e-e-e-E-E-E!” Being
now acquainted with the character of the
comic, we can no longer dispute that this story
is really an example of comical unmasking and
has no just claim to the term witticism. It
recalls wit only through the setting, through
the technical means of “representation through
a trifle”; here it is the cry which was found
sufficient to indicate the point. The fact remains,
however, that our feeling for the niceties
of speech, when we call on it for judgment,
does not oppose calling such a story a
witticism. We can find the explanation for
this in the reflection that usage of speech does
not enter scientifically into the nature of wit
so far as we have evolved it by means of this
painstaking examination. As it is a function
of the activities of wit to reopen hidden
<span class='pageno' id='Page_326'>326</span>sources of comic pleasure (p. 150), every artifice
which does not bring to light barefaced
comic may in looser analogy be called a witticism.
This is especially true in the case of
unmasking, though in other methods of comic-making
the appellation also holds good.<a id='r73'></a><a href='#f73' class='c007'><sup>[73]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>In the mechanism of “unmasking” one can
also utilize those processes of comic-making
already known to us which degrade the dignity
of individuals in that they call attention to one
of the common human frailties, but particularly
to the dependence of his mental functions
upon physical needs. Unmasking them
becomes equivalent to the reminder: This or
that one who is admired like a demigod is
only a human being like you and me after all.
Moreover, all efforts in this mechanism serve
to lay bare the monotonous psychic automatism
which is behind wealth and apparent freedom
of psychic achievements. We have become
acquainted with examples of such “unmasking”
through the witticisms dealing with marriage
agents, and at that time to be sure we
felt doubt whether we could rightly count
these stories as wit. Now we can decide with
more certainty that the anecdote of the echo
who reinforces all assertions of the marriage
<span class='pageno' id='Page_327'>327</span>agent and in the end reinforces the latter’s
admission that the bride has a hunch back with
the exclamation “And what a hunch!” is essentially
a comic story, an example of the unmasking
of the psychic automatism. But here
the comic story serves only as a façade; to
any one who wishes to note the hidden meaning
of the marriage agent, the whole remains a
splendidly put together piece of wit. He who
does not penetrate so far sees only the comic
story. The same is true of the other witticism
of the agent who, to refute an objection, finally
confirms the truth through the exclamation:
“But who in the world would lend them
anything?” This is a comic unmasking which
serves as a façade for a witticism. Still the
character of the wit is here quite evident, as
the speech of the agent is at the same time an
expression through the opposite. In trying to
prove that the people are rich he proves at the
same time that they are not rich but very poor.
Wit and the comic unite here and teach us
that a statement may be simultaneously witty
and comical.</p>

<p class='c008'>We eagerly grasp the opportunity to return
from the comic of unmasking to wit, for
our real task is to explain the relation between
wit and comic and not to determine the nature
of the comic. Hence to the case of uncovering
<span class='pageno' id='Page_328'>328</span>the psychic automatism, wherein our
feeling left us in doubt as to whether the matter
was comical or witty, we add another, the
case of nonsense-wit, wherein likewise wit and
the comic fuse. But our investigation will
ultimately show us that in this second case the
meeting of wit and comic may be theoretically
deduced.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the discussion of the techniques of wit
we have found that giving free play to such
modes of thinking as are common in the unconscious
and which in consciousness are conceived
only as “faulty thinking,” furnishes the
technical means of a great many witticisms.
We had then doubted their witty character
and were inclined to classify them simply as
comic stories. We could come to no decision
regarding our uncertainty because in the first
place the real character of wit was not familiar
to us. Later we found this character by following
the analogy to the dream-work as to
the compromise formed by the wit-work between
the demands of the rational critic and
the impulse not to abandon the old word-pleasure
and nonsense-pleasure. What thus came
into existence as a compromise, when the foreconscious
thought was left for a moment to
unconscious elaboration, satisfied both demands
in all cases, but it presented itself to the critic,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_329'>329</span>in various forms and had to stand various criticisms
from it. In one case wit succeeded in
surreptitiously assuming the form of an unimportant
but none the less admissible proposition;
a second time it smuggled itself into the
expression of a valuable thought. But within
the outer limit of the compromise activity it
made no effort to satisfy the critic, and defiantly
utilizing the pleasure-sources at its disposal,
it appeared before the critic as pure
nonsense. It had no fear of provoking contradiction
because it could rely on the fact that
the hearer would decipher the disfigurement of
the expression through the operation of his unconscious
and thus give back to it its meaning.</p>

<p class='c008'>Now in what case will wit appear to the
critic as nonsense? Particularly when it makes
use of those modes of thought, which are common
in the unconscious, but forbidden in conscious
thought; that is, when it resorts to
faulty thinking. Some of the modes of thinking,
of the unconscious, have also been retained
in conscious thinking, for example,
many forms of indirect expression, allusions,
etc., even though their conscious use
has to be much restricted. Using these
techniques wit will arouse little or no opposition
on the part of the critic; but this only
happens when it also uses that technical means
<span class='pageno' id='Page_330'>330</span>with which conscious thought no longer cares
to have anything to do. Wit can still further
avoid offending if it disguises the faulty thinking
by investing it with a semblance of logic
as in the story of the fancy cake and liqueur,
salmon with mayonnaise, and similar ones.
But should it present the faulty thinking undisguised,
the critic is sure to protest.</p>

<h4 class='c016'><em>The Meeting of Wit and the Comic</em></h4>

<p class='c017'>In this case, something else comes to the aid
of wit. The faulty thinking, which as a form
of thinking of the unconscious, wit utilizes for
its technique, appears comical to the critic,
although this is not necessarily the case. The
conscious giving of free play to the unconscious
and to those forms of thinking which are rejected
as faulty, furnishes a means for the production
of comic pleasure. This can be easily
understood, as a greater expenditure is surely
needed for the production of the foreconscious
investing energy than for the giving of free
play to the unconscious. When we hear the
thought which is formed like one from the unconscious
we compare it to its correct form,
and this results in a difference of expenditure
which gives origin to comic pleasure. A witticism
which makes use of such faulty thinking
as its technique and therefore appears absurd
<span class='pageno' id='Page_331'>331</span>can produce a comic impression at the same
time. If we do not strike the trail of the wit,
there remains to us only the comic or funny
story.</p>

<p class='c008'>The story of the borrowed kettle, which
showed a hole on being returned, whereupon
the borrower excused himself by stating that
in the first place he had not borrowed the kettle;
secondly, that it already had a hole when
he borrowed it; and thirdly, that he had returned
it intact without any hole (p. 82), is an
excellent example of a purely comic effect
through giving free play to one’s unconscious
modes of thinking. Just this mutual neutralization
of several thoughts, each of which is well
motivated in itself, is the province of the unconscious.
Corresponding to this, the dream in
which the unconscious thoughts become manifest,
also shows an absence of either—or.<a id='r74'></a><a href='#f74' class='c007'><sup>[74]</sup></a>
These are expressed by putting the thoughts
next to one another. In that dream example
given in my <cite>Interpretation of Dreams</cite>,<a id='r75'></a><a href='#f75' class='c007'><sup>[75]</sup></a> which
in spite of its complication I have chosen as
a type of the work of interpretation, I seek
to rid myself of the reproach that I have not
removed the pains of a patient by psychic
treatment. My arguments are: 1. she is herself
<span class='pageno' id='Page_332'>332</span>to blame for her illness, because she does
not wish to accept my solution, 2. her pains
are of organic origin, therefore none of my
concern, 3. her pains are connected with her
widowhood, for which I am certainly not to
blame, 4. her pains resulted from an injection
with a dirty syringe, which was given by
another. All these motives follow one another
just as though one did not exclude the
other. In order to escape the reproach that
it was nonsense I had to insert the words
“either—or” instead of the “and” of the
dream.</p>

<p class='c008'><em>A similar comical story is the one which tells
of a blacksmith in a Hungarian village who has
committed a crime punishable by death; the
bürgomaster, however, decreed that not the
smith but a tailor was to be hanged, as there
were two tailors in the village but only one
blacksmith, and the crime had to be expiated.</em>
Such a displacement of guilt from one person
to another naturally contradicts all laws of
conscious logic, but in no ways the mental
trends of the unconscious. I am in doubt
whether to call this story comic, and still I put
the story of the kettle among the witticisms.
Now I admit that it is far more correct to designate
the latter as comic rather than witty.
But now I understand how it happens that my
<span class='pageno' id='Page_333'>333</span>feelings, usually so reliable, can leave me in
the lurch as to whether this story be comic
or witty. The case in which I cannot come
to a conclusion through my feelings is the one
in which the comic results through the uncovering
of modes of thought which exclusively
belong to the unconscious. A story of that
kind can be comic and witty at the same time;
but it will impress me as being witty even if
it be only comic, because the use of the faulty
thinking of the unconscious reminds me of
wit, just as in the case of the arrangements
for the uncovering of the hidden comic discussed
before (p. 325).</p>

<p class='c008'>I must lay great stress upon making clear
this most delicate point of my analysis, namely,
the relation of wit to the comic, and will therefore
supplement what has been said with some
negative statements. First of all, I call attention
to the fact that the case of the meeting
of wit and comic treated here (p. 327) is not
identical with the preceding one. I grant it
is a fine distinction, but it can be drawn with
certainty. In the preceding case the comic
originated from the uncovering of the psychic
automatism. This is in no way peculiar to the
unconscious alone and it does not at all play a
conspicuous part in the technique of wit. Unmasking
appears only accidentally in relation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_334'>334</span>with wit, in that it serves another technique of
wit, namely, representation through the opposite.
But in the case of giving free play to
unconscious ways of thinking the union of wit
and comic is an essential one, because the
same method which is used by the first person
in wit as the technique of releasing pleasure
will naturally produce comic pleasure in the
third person.</p>

<p class='c008'>We might be tempted to generalize this last
case and seek the relation of wit to the comic
in the fact that the effect of wit upon the third
person follows the mechanism of comic pleasure.
But there is no question about that; contact
with the comic is not in any way found
in all nor even in most witticisms; in most
cases wit and the comic can be cleanly separated.
As often as wit succeeds in escaping
the appearance of absurdity, which is to say
in most witticisms of double meaning or of allusion,
one cannot discover any effect in the
hearer resembling the comic. One can make
the test with examples previously cited or with
some new ones given here.</p>

<p class='c008'>We might further believe that at least all
jokes with nonsense façades appear comical
and must impress us as such. But I recall
here the fact that such witticisms often have
a different effect on the hearer, calling forth
confusion and a tendency to rejection (see footnote,
p. 212). Therefore it evidently depends
whether the nonsense of the wit appears comical
or common plain nonsense, and the conditions
for this we have not yet investigated. Accordingly
we hold to the conclusion that wit, judging
by its nature, can be separated from the
comic, and that it unites with it on the one
hand only in certain special cases, on the other
in the tendency to gain pleasure from intellectual
sources.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the course of these examinations concerning
the relations of wit and the comic there
revealed itself to us that distinction which we
must emphasize as most significant, and which
at the same time points to a psychologically
important characteristic of the comic. We had
to transfer to the unconscious the source of
wit-pleasure; there is no occasion which can be
discovered for the same localization of the
comic. On the contrary all analyses which we
have made thus far indicate that the source
<span class='pageno' id='Page_336'>336</span>of comic pleasure lies in the comparison of
two expenditures, both of which we must
adjudge to the foreconscious. Wit and the
comic can above all be differentiated in the
psychic localization; <em>wit is, so to speak, the
contribution to the comic from the sphere of
the unconscious</em>.</p>

<h4 class='c016'><em>Comic of Imitation</em></h4>

<p class='c017'>We need not blame ourselves for digressing
from the subject, for the relation of wit to the
comic is really the occasion which urged us to
the examination of the comic. But it is time
for us to return to the point under discussion,
to the treatment of the means which serve to
produce the comic. We have advanced the
discussion of caricature and unmasking, because
from both of them we can borrow several
points of similarity for the analysis of the
comic of <em>imitation</em>. Imitation is mostly replaced
by caricature, which consists in the exaggeration
of certain otherwise not striking
traits, and also bears the character of degradation.
Still this does not seem to exhaust the
nature of imitation; it is incontestable that in
itself it represents an extraordinarily rich
source of comic pleasure, for we laugh particularly
over faithful imitations. It is not easy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_337'>337</span>to give a satisfactory explanation of this if we
do not accept Bergson’s view,<a id='r77'></a><a href='#f77' class='c007'><sup>[77]</sup></a> according to
which the comic of imitation is put next to the
comic produced by uncovering the psychic
automatism. Bergson believes that everything
gives a comic impression which manifests itself
in the shape of a machine-like inanimate movement
in the human being. His law is that
“the attitudes, gestures, and movements of
the human body are laughable in exact proportion
as that body reminds us of a mere
machine.” He explains the comic of imitation
by connecting it with a problem formulated
by Pascal in his <cite>Thoughts</cite>, why is it that we
laugh at the comparison of two faces that are
alike although neither of them excites laughter
by itself. “The truth is that a really living
life should never repeat itself. Wherever
there is repetition or complete similarity, we
always suspect some mechanism at work behind
the living.” Analyze the impression you get
from two faces that are too much alike, and
you will find that you are thinking of two
copies cast in the same mould, or two impressions
of the same soul, or two reproductions of
the same negative,—in a word, of some manufacturing
process or other. This deflection of
life towards the mechanical is here the real
<span class='pageno' id='Page_338'>338</span>cause of laughter (l. c., p. 34). We might say, it
is the degradation of the human to the mechanical
or inanimate. If we accept these
winning arguments of Bergson, it is moreover
not difficult to subject his view to our own
formula. Taught by experience that every
living being is different and demands a definite
amount of expenditure from our understanding,
we find ourselves disappointed when, as
a result of a perfect agreement or deceptive
imitation, we need no new expenditure. But
we are disappointed in the sense of being relieved,
and the expenditure of expectation
which has become superfluous is discharged
through laughter. The same formula will also
cover all cases of comic rigidity considered by
Bergson, such as professional habits, fixed
ideas, and modes of expression which are repeated
on every occasion. All these cases aim
to compare the expenditure of expectation
with what is commonly required for the understanding,
whereby the greater expectation depends
on observation of individual variety and
human plasticity. Hence in imitation the
source of comic pleasure is not the comic of
situation but that of expectation.</p>

<p class='c008'>As we trace the comic pleasure in general
to comparison, it is incumbent upon us to investigate
also the comic element of the comparison
<span class='pageno' id='Page_339'>339</span>itself, which likewise serves as a means
of producing the comic. Our interest in this
question will be enhanced when we recall that
in the case of comparison the “feeling” as
to whether something was to be classed as
witty or merely comical often left us in the
lurch (v. p. 114).</p>

<p class='c008'>The subject really deserves more attention
than we can bestow upon it. The main quality
for which we ask in comparison is whether
it is pertinent, that is, whether it really calls
our attention to an existing agreement between
two different objects. The original pleasure
in refinding the same thing (Groos, p. 103)
is not the only motive which favors the use
of comparison. Besides this there is the fact
that comparison is capable of a utilization
which facilitates intellectual work; when for
example, as is usually the case, one compares
the less familiar to the more familiar, the abstract
to the concrete, and explains through
this comparison the more strange and the more
difficult objects. With every such comparison,
especially of the abstract to the concrete,
there is a certain degradation and a certain
economy in abstraction expenditure (in the
sense of a conceptual mimicry) yet this naturally
does not suffice to render prominent
the character of the comic. The latter does not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_340'>340</span>emerge suddenly from the freed pleasure of
the comparison but comes gradually; there
are many cases which only touch the comic, in
which one might doubt whether they show the
comic character. The comparison undoubtedly
becomes comical when the <i><span lang="fr">niveau</span></i> difference
of the expenditure of abstraction between the
two things compared becomes increased, if
something serious and strange, especially of
intellectual or moral nature is compared to
something banal and lowly. The former release
of pleasure and the contribution from
the conditions of conceptual mimicry may perhaps
explain the gradual change—which is determined
by quantitative relations,—from the
universally pleasurable to the comic, which
takes place during the comparison. I am
certainly avoiding misunderstandings in that
I emphasize that I deduce the comic pleasure
in the comparison, not from the contrast of
the two things compared but from the difference
of the two abstraction expenditures.
The strange which is difficult to grasp, the abstract
and really intellectually sublime, through
its alleged agreement with a familiar lowly
one, in the imagination of which every abstraction
expenditure disappears, is now itself unmasked
as something equally lowly. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_341'>341</span>comic of comparison thus becomes reduced to
a case of degradation.</p>

<p class='c008'>The comparison, as we have seen above, can
now be witty without a trace of comic admixture,
especially when it happens to evade the
degradation. Thus the comparison of Truth
to a torch which one cannot carry through a
crowd without singeing somebody’s beard is
pure wit, because it takes an obsolete expression
(“The torch of truth”) at its full value
and not at all in a comical sense, and because
the torch as an object does not lack a certain
distinction, though it is a concrete object.
However, a comparison may just as well be
witty as comic, and what is more one may be
independent of the other, in that the comparison
becomes an aid for certain techniques of
wit, as, for example, unification or allusion.
Thus Nestroy’s comparison of memory to a
“Warehouse” (p. 120) is simultaneously comical
and witty, first, on account of the extraordinary
degradation to which the psychological
conception must consent in the comparison
to a “Warehouse,” and secondly, because he
who utilizes the comparison is a clerk, and in
this comparison he establishes a rather unexpected
unification between psychology and his
vocation. Heine’s verse, “until at last the
buttons tore from the pants of my patience,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_342'>342</span>seems at first an excellent example of a comic
degrading comparison, but on closer reflection
we must ascribe to it also the attribute of wittiness,
since the comparison as a means of allusion
strikes into the realm of the obscene and
causes a release of pleasure from the obscene.
Through a union not altogether incidental the
same material also gives us a resultant pleasure
which is at the same time comical and
witty; it does not matter whether or not the
conditions of the one promote the origin of the
other, such a union acts confusingly on the
“feeling” whose function it is to announce to
us whether we have before us wit or the comic,
and only a careful examination independent
of the disposition of pleasure can decide the
question.</p>

<p class='c008'>As tempting as it would be to trace these
more intimate determinations of comic pleasure,
the author must remember that neither
his previous education nor his daily vocation
justifies him in extending his investigations beyond
the spheres of wit, and he must confess
that it is precisely the subject of comic comparison
which makes him feel his incompetence.</p>

<p class='c008'>We are quite willing to be reminded that
many authors do not recognize the clear notional
and objective distinction between wit
and comic, as we were impelled to do, and that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_343'>343</span>they classify wit merely as “the comic of
speech” or “of words.” To test this view let
us select one example of intentional and one
of involuntary comic of speech and compare
it with wit. We have already mentioned before
that we are in a good position to distinguish
comic from witty speech. “With a
fork and with effort, his mother pulled him
out of the mess,” is only comical, but Heine’s
verse about the four castes of the population
of Göttingen: “Professors, students, Philistines,
and cattle,” is exquisitely witty.</p>

<p class='c008'>As an example of the intentional comic of
speech I will take as a model Stettenheim’s
<cite>Wippchen</cite>. We call Stettenheim witty because
he possesses the cleverness that evokes
the comic. The wit which one “has” in contradistinction
to the wit which one “makes,”
is indeed correctly conditioned by this ability.
It is true that the letters of Wippchen are
also witty in so far as they are interspersed
with a rich collection of all sorts of witticisms,
some of which very successful ones, (as “festively
undressed” when he speaks of a parade
of savages), but what lends the peculiar character
to these productions is not these isolated
witticisms, but the superabundant flow
of comic speech contained therein. Originally
<em>Wippchen</em> was certainly meant to represent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_344'>344</span>a satirical character, a modification of Freytag’s
Schmock, one of those uneducated persons
who trade in the educational treasure of
the nation and abuse it; but the pleasure in
the comic effect experienced in representing
this person seems gradually to have pushed to
the background the author’s satirical tendency.
Wippchen’s productions are for the most part
“comic nonsense.” The author has justly
utilized the pleasant mood resulting from the
accumulation of such achievements to present
beside the altogether admissible material all
sorts of absurdities which would be intolerable
in themselves. Wippchen’s nonsense appears
to be of a specific nature only on account of
its special technique. If we look closer into
some of these “witticisms,” we find that some
forms which have impressed their character on
the whole production are especially conspicuous.
Wippchen makes use mostly of compositions
(fusions), of modifications of familiar
expressions and quotations. He replaces some
of the banal elements in these expressions by
others which are usually more pretentious and
more valuable. This naturally comes near to
the techniques of wit.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_345'>345</span>
  <h4 class='c016'><em>The Comic of Speech</em></h4>
</div>

<p class='c017'>Some of the fusions taken from the preface
and the first pages are the following: “<em>Turkey’s
money is like the hay of the sea.</em>” This
is only a condensation of the two expressions,
“Money like hay,” “Money like the sands of
the sea.” Or: “<em>I am nothing but a leafless pillar
which tells of a vanished splendor</em>,” which
is a fusion of “leafless trunk” and “a pillar
which, etc.” Or: “<em>Where is Ariadne’s thread
which leads out of the Scylla of this Augean
stable?</em>” for which three different Greek myths
contribute an element each.</p>

<p class='c008'>The modifications and substitutions can be
treated collectively without much forcing; their
character can be seen from the following examples
which are peculiar to Wippchen, they are
regularly permeated by a different wording
which is more fluent, most banal, and reduced
to mere platitudes.</p>

<p class='c008'>“<em>To hang my paper and ink high.</em>” The
saying: “To hang one’s bread-basket high,”
expresses metaphorically the idea of placing
one under difficult conditions. But why not
stretch this figure to other material?</p>

<p class='c008'>“<em>Already in my youth Pegasus was alive in
me.</em>” When the word “pegasus” is replaced
by “the poet,” one can recognize it as an expression
<span class='pageno' id='Page_346'>346</span>often used in autobiographies. Naturally
“pegasus” is not the proper word to
replace the words “the poet,” but it has
thought associations to it and is a high-sounding
word.</p>

<p class='c008'>From Wippchen’s other numerous productions
some examples can be shown which present
the pure comic. As an example of comic
disillusionment the following can be cited:
“<em>For hours the battle raged, finally it remained
undecisive</em>”; an example of comical
unmasking (of ignorance) is the following:
“<em>Clio, the Medusa of history</em>,” or quotations
like the following: “<i><span lang="la">Habent sua fata morgana.</span></i>”
But our interest is aroused more by
the fusions and modifications because they recall
familiar techniques of wit. We may compare
them to such modification witticisms as
the following: “He has a great future behind
him,” and Lichtenberg’s modification witticisms
such as: “New baths heal well,” etc. Should
Wippchen’s productions having the same technique
be called witticisms, or what distinguishes
them from the latter?</p>

<p class='c008'>It is surely not difficult to answer this.
Let us remember that wit presents to the
hearer a double face, and forces him to two
different views. In nonsense-witticisms such
as those mentioned last, one view, which considers
<span class='pageno' id='Page_347'>347</span>only the wording, states that they are
nonsense; the other view, which, in obedience
to suggestion, follows the road that leads
through the hearer’s unconscious, finds very
good sense in these witticisms. In Wippchen’s
wit-like productions one of these views of wit
is empty, as if stunted. It is a Janus head
with only one countenance developed. One
would get nowhere should he be tempted to
proceed by means of this technique to the unconscious.
The condensations lead to no case
in which the two fused elements really result
in a new sense; they fall to pieces when an
attempt is made to analyze them. As in wit,
the modifications and substitutions lead to a
current and familiar wording, but they themselves
tell us little else and as a rule nothing
that is of any possible use. Hence the only
thing remaining to these “witticisms” is the
nonsense view. Whether such productions,
which have freed themselves from one of the
most essential characters of wit, should be
called “bad” wit or not wit at all, every one
must decide as he feels inclined.</p>

<p class='c008'>There is no doubt that such stunted wit produces
a comic effect for which we can account
in more than one way. Either the comic
originates through the uncovering of the unconscious
modes of thinking in a manner similar
<span class='pageno' id='Page_348'>348</span>to the cases considered above, or the wit
originates by comparison with perfect wit.
Nothing prevents us from assuming that we
here deal with a union of both modes of origin
of the comic pleasure. It is not to be denied
that it is precisely the inadequate dependence
on wit which here shapes the nonsense into
comic nonsense.</p>

<h4 class='c016'><em>Comic of Inadequacy</em></h4>

<p class='c017'>There are, of course, other quite apparent
cases, in which such inadequacy produced by
the comparison with wit, makes the nonsense
irresistibly comic. The counterpart to wit, the
riddle, can perhaps give us better examples
for this than wit itself. A facetious question
states: <em>What is this: It hangs on the wall and
one can dry his hands on it? It would be a
foolish riddle if the answer were: a towel. On
the contrary this answer is rejected with the
statement: No, it is a herring,—“But, for
mercy’s sake,” is the objection, “a herring
does not hang on the wall.”—“But you can
hang it there,”—“But who wants to dry his
hands on a herring?”—“Well,” is the soft
answer, “you don’t have to.”</em> This explanation
given through two typical displacements
show how much this question lacks of being a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_349'>349</span>real riddle, and because of this absolute insufficiency
it impresses one as irresistibly comic,
rather than mere nonsensical foolishness.
Through such means, that is, by not restricting
essential conditions, wit, riddles, and other
forms, which in themselves produce no comic
pleasure, can be made into sources of comic
pleasure.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is not so difficult to understand the case
of the involuntary comic of speech which we
can perhaps find realized with as much frequency
as we like in the poems of Frederika
Kempner.<a id='r78'></a><a href='#f78' class='c007'><sup>[78]</sup></a></p>

</div>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_350'>350</span>There is nothing here which makes one think
of wit. Doubtless, however, it is the inadequacy
of these “poetic productions,” as the very extraordinary
clumsiness of the expressions which
recall the most commonplace or newspaper
style, the ingenious poverty of thoughts, the
absence of every trace of poetic manner of
thinking or speaking,—it is all these inadequacies
which make these poems comic. Nevertheless
it is not at all self-evident that we
should find Kempner’s poems comical; many
similar productions we merely consider very
bad, we do not laugh at them but are rather
vexed with them. But here it is the great disparity
in our demand of a poem which impels
us to the comic conception; where this difference
is less, we are inclined to criticise rather
than laugh. The comic effect of Kempner’s
poetic productions is furthermore assured by
the additional circumstances of the lady author’s
unmistakably good intentions, and by
the fact that her helpless phrases disarm our
feeling of mockery and anger. We are now
reminded of a problem the consideration of
which we have so far postponed. The difference
of expenditure is surely the main condition
of the comic pleasure, but observation
teaches that such difference does not always
produce pleasure. What other conditions must
<span class='pageno' id='Page_351'>351</span>be added, or what disturbances must be
checked in order that pleasure should result
from the difference of expenditure? But before
proceeding with the answers to these
questions we wish to verify what was said in
the conclusions of the former discussion,
namely, that the comic of speech is not synonymous
with wit, and that wit must be something
quite different from speech comic.</p>

<p class='c008'>As we are about to attack the problem just
formulated, concerning the conditions of the
origin of comic pleasure from the difference of
expenditure, we may permit ourselves to facilitate
this task so as to cause ourselves some
pleasure. To give a correct answer to this
question would amount to an exhaustive
presentation of the nature of the comic for
which we are fitted neither by ability nor authority.
We shall therefore again be content to
elucidate the problem of the comic only
so far as it distinctly separates itself from
wit.</p>

<p class='c008'>All theories of the comic were objected to
by the critics on the ground that in defining
the comic these theories overlooked the essential
element of it. This can be seen from the
following theories, with their objections. The
comic depends on a contrasting idea; yes, in
so far as this contrast effects one comically and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_352'>352</span>in no other way. The feeling of the comic results
from the dwindling away of an expectation;
yes, if the disappointment does not prove
to be painful. There is no doubt that these
objections are justified, but they are overestimated
if one concludes from them that the essential
characteristic mark of the comic has
hitherto escaped our conception. What depreciates
the general validity of these definitions
are conditions which are indispensable for the
origin of the comic pleasure, but which will be
searched in vain for the nature of comic pleasure.
The rejection of the objections and the
explanations of the contradictions to the definitions
of the comic will become easy for us,
only after we trace back comic pleasure to the
difference resulting from a comparison of two
expenditures. Comic pleasure and the effect
by which it is recognized—laughter, can originate
only when this difference is no longer
utilizable and when it is capable of discharge.
We gain no pleasurable effect, or at most a
flighty feeling of pleasure in which the comic
does not appear, if the difference is put to
other use as soon as it is recognized. Just
as special precautions must be taken in wit,
in order to guard against making new use of
expenditure recognized as superfluous, so also
can comic pleasure originate only under relations
<span class='pageno' id='Page_353'>353</span>which fulfil this latter condition. The
cases in which such differences of expenditure
originate in our ideational life are therefore
uncommonly numerous, while the cases in
which the comic originates from them is comparatively
very rare.</p>

<h4 class='c016'><em>The Conditions of Isolation of the Comic</em></h4>

<p class='c017'>Two observations obtrude themselves upon
the observer who reviews even only superficially
the origin of comic pleasure from the difference
of expenditure; first, that there are cases in
which the comic appears regularly and as if
necessarily; and, in contrast to these cases,
others in which this appearance depends on the
conditions of the case and on the viewpoint of
the observer; but secondly, that unusually
large differences very often triumph over unfavorable
conditions, so that the comic feeling
originates in spite of it. In reference to the
first point one may set up two classes, the inevitable
comic and the accidental comic, although
one will have to be prepared from the
beginning to find exceptions in the first class
to the inevitableness of the comic. It would
be tempting to follow the conditions which are
essential to each class.</p>

<p class='c008'>What is important in the second class are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_354'>354</span>the conditions of which one may be designated
as the “isolation” of the comic case. A closer
analysis renders conspicuous relations something
like the following:</p>

<p class='c008'>a) The favorable condition for the origin
of comic pleasure is brought about by a general
happy disposition in which “one is in the
mood for laughing.” In happy toxic states almost
everything seems comic, which probably
results from a comparison with the expenditure
in normal conditions. For wit, the comic,
and all similar methods of gaining pleasure
from the psychic activities, are nothing but
ways to regain this happy state—euphoria—from
one single point, when it does not exist
as a general disposition of the psyche.</p>

<p class='c008'>b) A similar favorable condition is produced
by the expectation of the comic or by
putting one’s self in the right mood for comic
pleasure. Hence when the intention to make
things comical exists and when this feeling is
shared by others, the differences required are
so slight that they probably would have been
overlooked had they been experienced in unpremeditated
occurrences. He who decides to
attend a comic lecture or a farce at the theater
is indebted to this intention for laughing over
things which in his everyday life would hardly
produce in him a comic effect. He finally
<span class='pageno' id='Page_355'>355</span>laughs at the recollection of having laughed, at
the expectation of laughing, and at the appearance
of the one who is to present the comic,
even before the latter makes the attempt to
make him laugh. It is for this reason that
people admit that they are ashamed of that
which made them laugh at the theater.</p>

<p class='c008'>c) Unfavorable conditions for the comic result
from the kind of psychic activity which
may occupy the individual at the moment.
Imaginative or mental activity tending towards
serious aims disturbs the discharging capacity
of the investing energies which the activity
needs for its own displacements, so that only
unexpected and great differences of expenditure
can break through to form comic pleasure.
All manner of mental processes far
enough removed from the obvious to cause a
suspension of ideational mimicry are unfavorable
to the comic; in abstract contemplation
there is hardly any room left for the comic,
except when this form of thinking is suddenly
interrupted.</p>

<p class='c008'>d) The occasion for releasing comic pleasure
vanishes when the attention is fixed on the
comparison capable of giving rise to the comic.
Under such circumstances the comic force is
lost from that which is otherwise sure to produce
a comic effect. A movement or a mental
<span class='pageno' id='Page_356'>356</span>activity cannot become comical to him whose
interest is fixed at the time of comparing this
movement with a standard which distinctly
presents itself to him. Thus the examiner does
not see the comical in the nonsense produced
by the student in his ignorance; he is simply
annoyed by it, whereas the offender’s classmates
who are more interested in his chances
of passing the examination than in what he
knows, laugh heartily over the same nonsense.
The teacher of dancing or gymnastics seldom
has any eyes for the comic movements of his
pupils, and the preacher entirely loses sight of
humanity’s defects of character, which the
writer of comedy brings out with so much effect.
The comic process cannot stand examination
by the attention, it must be able to proceed
absolutely unnoticed in a manner similar
to wit. But for good reasons, it would contradict
the nomenclature of “conscious processes”
which I have used in <cite>The Interpretation
of Dreams</cite>, if one wished to call it of
necessity <em>unconscious</em>. It rather belongs to
the <em>foreconscious</em>, and one may use the fitting
name “automatic” for all those processes
which are enacted in the foreconscious and
dispense with the attention energy which is
connected with consciousness. The process
of comparison of the expenditures must remain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_357'>357</span>automatic if it is to produce comic
pleasure.</p>

<h4 class='c016'><em>Conditions Disturbing the Discharge</em></h4>

<p class='c017'>e) It is exceedingly disturbing to the comic
if the case from which it originates gives rise
at the same time to a marked release of affect.
The discharge of the affective difference
is then as a rule excluded. Affects, disposition,
and the attitude of the individual in occasional
cases make it clear that the comic comes or
goes with the viewpoint of the individual person;
that only in exceptional cases is there an
absolute comic. The dependence or relativity
of the comic is therefore much greater than
of wit, which never happens but is regularly
made, and at its production one may already
give attention to the conditions under which
it finds acceptance. But affective development
is the most intensive of the conditions which
disturb the comic, the significance of which is
well known.<a id='r79'></a><a href='#f79' class='c007'><sup>[79]</sup></a> It is therefore said that the
comic feeling comes most in tolerably indifferent
cases which evince no strong feelings or
interests. Nevertheless it is just in cases with
affective release that one may witness the production
of a particularly strong expenditure-difference
<span class='pageno' id='Page_358'>358</span>in the automatism of discharge.
When Colonel Butler answers Octavio’s admonitions
with “bitter laughter,” exclaiming:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c018'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Thanks from the house of Austria!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c019'>his bitterness has thus not prevented the laughter
which results from the recollection of the
disappointment which he believes he has experienced;
and on the other hand, the magnitude
of this disappointment could not have been
more impressively depicted by the poet than
by showing it capable of affecting laughter in
the midst of the storm of unchained affects.
It is my belief that this explanation may be
applicable in all cases in which laughing occurs
on other than pleasurable occasions, and in
conjunction with exceedingly painful or tense
affects.</p>

<p class='c008'>f) If we also mention that the development
of the comic pleasure can be promoted by
means of any other pleasurable addition to the
case which acts like a sort of contact-effect
(after the manner of the fore-pleasure principle
in the tendency-wit), then we have discussed
surely not all the conditions of comic
pleasure, yet enough of them to serve our purpose.
We then see that no other assumption
so easily covers these conditions, as well as the
inconstancy and dependence of the comic effect,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_359'>359</span>as this: the assumption that comic pleasure
is derived from the discharge of a difference,
which under many conditions can be diverted
to a different use than discharge.</p>

<p class='c006'>It still remains to give a thorough consideration
of the comic of the sexual and obscene,
but we shall only skim over it with a few observations.
Here, too, we shall take the act
of exposing one’s body as the starting-point.
An accidental exposure produces a comical
effect on us, because we compare the ease with
which we attained the enjoyment of this view
with the great expenditure otherwise necessary
for the attainment of this object. The case
thus comes nearer to the naïve-comic, but it is
simpler than the latter. In every case of exhibitionism
in which we are made spectators—or,
in the case of the smutty joke hearers,—we
play the part of the third person, and the
person exposed is made comical. We have
heard that it is the purpose of wit to replace
obscenity and in this manner to reopen a
source of comic pleasure that has been lost.
On the contrary, spying out an exposure forms
no example of the comic for the one spying,
because the effort he exerts thereby abrogates
the condition of comic pleasure; the only thing
remaining is the sexual pleasure in what is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_360'>360</span>seen. If the spy relates to another what he
has seen, the person looked at again becomes
comical, because the viewpoint that predominates
is that the expenditure was omitted
which would have been necessary for the concealment
of the private parts. At all events,
the sphere of the sexual or obscene offers the
richest opportunities for gaining comic pleasure
beside the pleasurable sexual stimulation,
as it exposes the person’s dependence on his
physical needs (degradation) or it can uncover
behind the spiritual love the physical demands
of the same (unmasking.)</p>

<h4 class='c016'><em>The Psychogenesis of the Comic</em></h4>

<p class='c017'>An invitation to seek the understanding of
the comic in its psychogenesis comes surprisingly
from Bergson’s well written and
stimulating book <em>Laughter</em>. Bergson, whose
formula for the conception of the comic character
has already become known to us—“mechanization
of life,” “the substitution of
something mechanical for the natural”—reaches
by obvious associations from automatism
to the automaton, and seeks to trace
a series of comic effects to the blurred memories
of children’s toys. In this connection he once
reaches this viewpoint, which, to be sure, he soon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_361'>361</span>drops; he seeks to trace the comic to the after-effect
of childish pleasure. “Perhaps we
ought even to carry simplification still farther,
and, going back to our earliest recollection,
try to discover in the games that amused us
as children the first faint traces of the combinations
that make us laugh as grown-up
persons.”... “Above all, we are too apt
to ignore the childish element, so to speak,
latent in most of our joyful emotions” (p. 67).
As we have now traced wit to that childish
playing with words and thoughts which is
prohibited by the rational critic, we must be
tempted to trace also these infantile roots of
the comic, conjectured by Bergson.</p>

<p class='c008'>As a matter of fact we meet a whole series
of conditions which seem most promising, when
we examine the relation of the comic to the
child. The child itself does not by any means
seem comic to us, although its character fulfills
all conditions which, in comparison to our own,
would result in a comic difference. Thus we
see the immoderate expenditure of motion as
well as the slight psychic expenditure, the control
of the psychic activities through bodily
functions, and other features. The child gives
us a comic impression only when it does not
behave as a child but as an earnest grown-up,
and even then it affects us only in the same
<span class='pageno' id='Page_362'>362</span>manner as other persons in disguise; but as
long as it retains the nature of the child our
perception of it furnishes us a pure pleasure,
which perhaps recalls the comic. We call it
naïve in so far as it displays to us the absence
of inhibitions, and we call naïve-comic those of
its utterances which in another we would have
considered obscene or witty.</p>

<p class='c008'>On the other hand the child lacks all feeling
for the comic. This sentence seems to say
no more than that this comic feeling, like many
others, first makes its appearance in the course
of psychic development; and that would by no
means be remarkable, especially since we must
admit that it shows itself distinctly even during
years which must be accredited to childhood.
Nevertheless it can be demonstrated
that the assertion that the child lacks feeling
for the comic has a deeper meaning than one
would suppose. In the first place it will readily
be seen that it cannot be different, if our
conception is correct, that the comic feeling results
from a difference of expenditure produced
in the effort to understand the other.
Let us again take comic motion as an example.
The comparison which furnishes the difference
reads as follows, when put in conscious formulæ:
“So he does it,” and: “So I would do
it,” or “So I have done it.” But the child
<span class='pageno' id='Page_363'>363</span>lacks the standard contained in the second
sentence, it understands simply through imitation;
it just does it. Education of the child
furnishes it with the standard: “So you shall
do it,” and if it now makes use of the same
in comparisons, the nearest conclusion is: “He
has not done it right, and I can do it better.”
In this case it laughs at the other, it laughs
at him with a feeling of superiority. There
is nothing to prevent us from tracing this
laughter also to a difference of expenditure;
but according to the analogy with the examples
of laughter occurring in us we may conclude
that the comic feeling is not experienced
by the child when it laughs as an expression
of superiority. It is a laughter of pure pleasure.
In our own case whenever the judgment
of our own superiority occurs we smile rather
than laugh, or if we laugh, we are still able
to distinguish clearly this conscious realization
of our superiority from the comic which makes
us laugh.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is probably correct to say that in many
cases which we perceive as “comical” and
which we cannot explain, the child laughs out
of pure pleasure, whereas the child’s motives
are clear and assignable. If, for instance,
some one slips on the street and falls, we laugh
because this impression—we know not why—is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_364'>364</span>comical. The child laughs in the same case
out of a feeling of superiority or out of joy
over the calamity of others. It amounts to
saying: “You fell, but I did not.” Certain
pleasure motives of the child seems to be lost
for us grown-ups, but as a substitute for these
we perceive under the same conditions the
“comic” feeling.</p>

<h4 class='c016'><em>The Infantile and the Comic</em></h4>

<p class='c017'>If we were permitted to generalize, it would
seem very tempting to transfer the desired
specific character of the comic into the awakening
of the infantile, and to conceive the
comic as a regaining of “lost infantile laughing.”
One could then say, “I laugh every time
over a difference of expenditure between the
other and myself, when I discover in the other
the child.” Or expressed more precisely, the
whole comparison leading to the comic would
read as follows:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c018'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“He does it this way—I do it differently—</div>
      <div class='line'>He does it just as I did when I was a child.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>This laughter would thus result every time
from the comparison between the ego of the
grown-up and the ego of the child. The uncertainty
itself of the comic difference, causing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_365'>365</span>now the lesser and now the greater expenditure
to appear comical to me, would correspond
to the infantile determination; the comic
therein is actually always on the side of the infantile.</p>

<p class='c008'>This is not contradicted by the fact that the
child itself as an object of comparison does not
make a comic impression on me but a purely
pleasurable one, nor by the fact that this comparison
with the infantile produces a comic
effect only when any other use of the difference
is avoided. For the conditions of the
discharge come thereby into consideration.
Everything that confines a psychic process in
an association of ideas works against the discharge
of the surplus occupation of energy
and directs the same to other utilization; whatever
isolates a psychic act favors the discharge.
By consciously focussing on the child as the
person of comparison, the discharge necessary
for the production of comic pleasure therefore
becomes impossible; only in foreconscious energetic
states is there a similar approach to the
isolation which we may moreover also ascribe
to the psychic processes in the child. The addition
to the comparison: “Thus I have also
done it as a child,” from which the comic effect
would emanate, could come into consideration
for the average difference only when no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_366'>366</span>other association could obtain control over the
freed surplus.</p>

<p class='c008'>If we still continue with our attempt to find
the nature of the comic in the foreconscious
association of the infantile, we have to go a
step further than Bergson and admit that the
comparison resulting in the comic need not
necessarily awake old childish pleasure and
play, but that it is enough if it touches the
childish nature in general, perhaps even childish
pain. Herein we deviate from Bergson,
but remain consistent with ourselves, when we
connect the comic pleasure not with remembered
pleasure but always with a comparison.
This is possible, for cases of the first kind comprise
in a measure those which are regularly
and irresistibly comic. Let us now draw up
the scheme of the comic possibilities instanced
above. We stated that the comic difference
would be found either</p>

<p class='c008'>(a) through a comparison between the other
and one’s self, or (b) through a comparison altogether
within the other, or (c) through a
comparison altogether within one’s self.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the first case the other would appear to
me as a child, in the second he would put himself
on the level of a child, and in the third I
would find the child in myself. To the first
class belong the comic of movement and of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_367'>367</span>forms, of psychic activity and of character.
The infantile corresponding to it would be the
motion-impulse and the inferior mental and
moral development of the child, so that the fool
would perhaps become comical to me by reminding
me of a lazy child, and the bad person
by reminding me of a naughty child.
The only time one might speak of a childish
pleasure lost to grown-ups would be where the
child’s own motion pleasure came into consideration.</p>

<p class='c008'>The second case, in which the comic altogether
depends on identification with the other,
comprises numerous possibilities such as the
comic situation, exaggeration (caricature), imitation,
degradation, and unmasking. It is
under this head that the presentation of infantile
viewpoints mostly take place. For the
comic situation is largely based on embarrassment,
in which we feel again the helplessness
of the child. The worst of these embarrassments,
the disturbance of other activities
through the imperative demands of natural
wants, corresponds to the child’s lack of control
of the physical functions. Where the
comic situation acts through repetitions it is
based on the pleasure of constant repetition
peculiar to the child (asking questions, telling
stories), through which it makes itself a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_368'>368</span>nuisance to grown-ups. Exaggeration, which
also affords pleasure even to the grown-up in
so far as it is justified by his reason, corresponds
to the characteristic want of moderation
in the child, and its ignorance of all quantitative
relations which it later really learns to
know as qualitative. To keep within bounds,
to practice moderation even in permissible feelings
is a late fruit of education, and is gained
through opposing inhibitions of the psychic
activity acquired in the same association.
Wherever this association is weakened as in the
unconscious of dreams and in the monoideation
of the psychoneuroses, the want of moderation
of the child again makes its appearance.</p>

<p class='c008'>The understanding of comic imitation has
caused us many difficulties so long as we left
out of consideration the infantile factor. But
imitation is the child’s best art and is the impelling
motive of most of its playing. The
child’s ambition is not so much to distinguish
himself among his equals as to imitate the big
fellows. The relation of the child to the
grown-up determines also the comic of degradation,
which corresponds to the lowering of the
grown-up in the life of the child. Few things
can afford the child greater pleasure than when
the grown-up lowers himself to its level, disregards
his superiority, and plays with the child
<span class='pageno' id='Page_369'>369</span>as its equal. The alleviation which furnishes
the child pure pleasure is a debasement used by
the adult as a means of making things comic
and as a source of comic pleasure. As for unmasking
we know that it is based on degradation.</p>

<p class='c008'>The infantile determination of the third case,
the comic of expectation, presents most of the
difficulties; this really explains why those authors
who put this case to the foreground in
their conception of the comic, found no occasion
to consider the infantile factor in their
studies of the comic. The comic of expectation
is farthest from the child’s thoughts, the
ability to understand this is the latest quality
to appear in him. Most of those cases which
produce a comic effect in the grown-up are
probably felt by the child as a disappointment.
One can refer, however, to the blissful expectation
and gullibility of the child in order
to understand why one considers himself as
comical “as a child,” when he succumbs to
comic disappointment.</p>

<p class='c008'>If the preceding remarks produce a certain
probability that the comic feeling may be
translated into the thought; everything is comic
that does not fit the grown-up, I still do not
feel bold enough,—in view of my whole position
to the problem of the comic—to defend
<span class='pageno' id='Page_370'>370</span>this last proposition with the same earnestness
as those that I formulated before. I am unable
to decide whether the lowering to the level
of the child is only a special case of comic
degradation, or whether everything comical
fundamentally depends on the degradation to
the level of the child.<a id='r80'></a><a href='#f80' class='c007'><sup>[80]</sup></a></p>

<h4 class='c016'><em>Humor</em></h4>

<p class='c017'>An examination of the comic, however superficial
it may be, would be most incomplete if
it did not devote at least a few remarks to the
consideration of <em>humor</em>. There is so little
doubt as to the essential relationship between
the two that a tentative explanation of the
comic must furnish at least one component for
the understanding of humor. It does not matter
how much appropriate and important material
was presented as an appreciation of humor,
which, as one of the highest psychic functions,
enjoys the special favor of thinkers, we
still cannot elude the temptation to express
its essence through an approach to the formulæ
given for wit and the comic.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_371'>371</span>We have heard that the release of painful
emotions is the strongest hindrance to the
comic effect. Just as aimless motion causes
harm, stupidity mischief, and disappointment
pain;—the possibility of a comic effect eventually
ends, at least for him who cannot defend
himself against such pain, who is himself affected
by it or must participate in it, whereas
the disinterested party shows by his behavior
that the situation of the case in question contains
everything necessary to produce comic
effect. Humor is thus a means to gain pleasure
despite the painful affects which disturb
it; it acts as a substitute for this affective development,
and takes its place. If we are in
a situation which tempts us to liberate painful
affects according to our habits, and motives
then urge us to suppress these affects <i><span lang="la">statu
nascendi</span></i>, we have the conditions for humor.
In the cases just cited the person affected by
misfortune, pain, etc., could obtain humoristic
pleasure while the disinterested party laughs
over the comic pleasure. We can only say that
the pleasure of humor results at the cost of
this discontinued liberation of affect; it originates
through the <em>economized expenditure of
affect</em>.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_372'>372</span>
  <h4 class='c016'><em>The Economy in Expenditure of Affect</em></h4>
</div>

<p class='c017'>Humor is the most self-sufficient of the
forms of the comic; its process consummating
itself in one single person and the participation
of another adds nothing new to it. I can
enjoy the pleasure of humor originating in myself
without feeling the necessity of imparting
it to another. It is not easy to tell what happens
dining the production of humoristic pleasure
in a person; but one gains a certain insight
by investigating these cases of humor
which have emanated from persons with whom
we have entered into a sympathetic understanding.
By sympathetically understanding
the humoristic person in these cases one gets
the same pleasure. The coarsest form of humor,
the so-called humor of the gallows or
grim-humor (<i><span lang="no">Galgenhumor</span></i>), may enlighten
us in this regard. The rogue, on being led to
execution on Monday, remarked: “Yes, this
week is beginning well.” This is really a witticism,
as the remark is quite appropriate in itself,
on the other hand it is displaced in the
most nonsensical fashion, as there can be no
further happening for him this week. But it
required humor to make such wit, that is, to
overlook what distinguished the beginning of
this week from other weeks, and to deny the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_373'>373</span>difference which could give rise to motives for
very particular emotional feelings. The case
is the same when on the way to the gallows he
requests a neckerchief for his bare neck, in
order to guard against taking cold, a precaution
which would be quite praiseworthy under
different circumstances, but becomes exceedingly
superfluous and indifferent in view of
the impending fate of this same neck. We
must say that there is something like greatness
of soul in this <em>blague</em>, in this clinging to his
usual nature and in deviating from that which
would overthrow and drive this nature into
despair. This form of grandeur of humor thus
appears unmistakably in cases in which our
admiration is not inhibited by the circumstances
of the humoristic person.</p>

<p class='c008'>In Victor Hugo’s <cite>Ernani</cite> the bandit who
entered into a conspiracy against his king,
Charles I, of Spain, (Charles V, as the German
Emperor), falls into the hands of his
most powerful enemy; he foresees his fate; as
one convicted of high treason his head will
fall. But this prospect does not deter him
from introducing himself as a hereditary
Grandee of Spain and from declaring that he
has no intention of waiving any prerogative
belonging to such personage. A Grandee of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_374'>374</span>Spain could appear before his royal master
with his head covered. Well:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c018'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“<span lang="fr">Nos têtes ont le droit</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span lang="fr">De tomber couvertes devant de toi.</span>”<a id='r81'></a><a href='#f81' class='c007'><sup>[81]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c019'>This is excellent humor and if we do not laugh
on hearing it, it is because our admiration covers
the humoristic pleasure. In the case of the
rogue who did not wish to take cold on the
way to the gallows we roar with laughter.
The situation which should have driven this
criminal to despair, might have evoked in us
intense pity, but this pity is inhibited because
we understand that he who is most concerned
is quite indifferent to the situation. As a result
of this understanding the expenditure for
pity, which was already prepared in us, became
inapplicable and we laughed it off. The indifference
of the rogue, which we notice has
cost him a great expenditure of psychic labor,
infects us as it were.</p>

<p class='c008'>Economy of sympathy is one of the most
frequent sources of humoristic pleasure.
Mark Twain’s humor usually follows this
mechanism. When he tells us about the life of
his brother, how, as mi employee in a large
road-building enterprise, he was hurled into
the air through a premature explosion of a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_375'>375</span>blast, to come to earth again far from the place
where he was working, feelings of sympathy
for this unfortunate are invariably aroused in
us. We should like to inquire whether he sustained
no injury in this accident; but the continuation
of the story that the brother lost a
half-day’s pay for being away from the place
he worked diverts us entirely from sympathy
and makes us almost as hard-hearted as that
employer, and just as indifferent to the possible
injury to the victim’s health. Another time
Mark Twain presents us his pedigree, which he
traces back almost as far back as one of the
companions of Columbus. But after describing
the character of this ancestor, whose entire
possessions consisted of several pieces of linen
each bearing a different mark, we cannot help
laughing at the expense of the stored-up piety,
a piety which characterized our frame of mind
at the beginning of this family history. The
mechanism of humoristic pleasure is not disturbed
by our knowing that this family history
is a fictitious one, and that this fiction serves
a satirical tendency to expose the embellishments
which result in imparting such pedigrees
to others; it is just as independent of the conditions
of reality as the manufactured comic.
Another of Mark Twain’s stories relates how
his brother constructed for himself subterranean
<span class='pageno' id='Page_376'>376</span>quarters into which he brought a bed, a
table, and a lamp, and that as a roof he used
a large piece of sail-cloth with a hole through
the centre; how during the night after the
room was completed, a cow being driven home
fell through the opening in the ceiling on to
the table and extinguished the lamp; how his
brother helped patiently to hoist the animal out
and to rearrange everything; how he did the
same thing when the same disturbance was repeated
the following night; and then every
succeeding night; such a story becomes comical
through repetition. But Mark Twain
closes with the information that in the forty-sixth
night when the cow again fell through,
his brother finally remarked that the thing was
beginning to grow monotonous; and here we
can no longer restrain our humoristic pleasure,
for we had long expected to hear how the
brother would express his anger over this
chronic <i><span lang="fr">malheur</span></i>. The slight humor which we
draw from our own life we usually produce at
the expense of anger instead of irritating ourselves.<a id='r82'></a><a href='#f82' class='c007'><sup>[82]</sup></a></p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_377'>377</span>
  <h4 class='c016'><em>Forms of Humor</em></h4>
</div>

<p class='c017'>The forms of humor are extraordinarily
varied according to the nature of the emotional
feelings which are economized in favor of humor,
as sympathy, anger, pain, compassion,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_378'>378</span>etc. And this series seems incomplete because
the sphere of humor experiences a constant enlargement,
as often as an artist or writer succeeds
in mastering humoristically the, as yet,
unconquered emotional feelings and in making
them, through artifices similar to those in the
above example, a source of humoristic pleasure.
Thus the artists of <i><span lang="la">Simplicissimus</span></i>
have worked wonders in gaining humor at the
expense of fear and disgust. The manifestations
of humor are above all determined by two
peculiarities, which are connected with the conditions
of its origin. In the first place, humor
may appear fused with wit or any other form
of the comic; whereby it is entrusted with the
task of removing a possible emotional development
which would form a hindrance to the
pleasurable effect. Secondly, it can entirely
set aside this emotional development or only
partially, which is really the more frequent
case, because the simpler function and the different
forms of “broken”<a id='r83'></a><a href='#f83' class='c007'><sup>[83]</sup></a> humor, results in
that humor which smiles under its tears. It
withdraws from the affect a part of its energy
and gives instead the accompanying humoristic
sound.</p>

<p class='c008'>As may be noticed by former examples the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_379'>379</span>humoristic pleasure gained by entering into
sympathy with a thing results from a special
technique resembling displacement through
which the liberation of affect held ready is disappointed
and the energy occupation is deflected
to other, and, not often, to secondary
matters. This does not help us, however, to
understand the process by which the displacement
from the development of affect proceeds
in the humoristic person himself. We see that
the recipient intimates the producer of the
humor in his psychic processes, but  we
discover nothing thereby concerning the
forces which make this process possible in
the latter.</p>

<p class='c008'>We can only say, when, for example, somebody
succeeds in paying no heed to a painful
affect because he holds before himself the
greatness of the world’s interest as a contrast
to his own smallness, that we see in this no
function of humor but one of philosophic
thinking, and we gain no pleasure even if we
put ourselves into his train of thought. The
humoristic displacement is therefore just as
impossible in the light of conscious attention as
is the comic comparison; like the latter it is
connected with the condition to remain in the
foreconscious—that is to say, to remain automatic.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_380'>380</span>One reaches some solution of humoristic displacement
if one examines it in the light of a
defense process. The defense processes are
the psychic correlates of the flight reflex and
follow the task of guarding against the origin
of pain from inner sources; in fulfilling this
task they serve the psychic function as an
automatic adjustment, which finally proves
harmful and therefore must be subjected to
the control of the conscious thinking. A
definite form of this defense, the failure of repression,
I have demonstrated as the effective
mechanism in the origin of the psychoneuroses.
Humor can now be conceived as the loftiest
variant of this defense activity. It disdains to
withdraw from conscious attention the ideas
which are connected with the painful affect, as
repression does, and thus it overcomes the defense
automatism. It brings this about by
finding the means to withdraw the energy resulting
from the liberation of pain which is held
in readiness and through discharge changes the
same into pleasure. It is even credible that it is
again the connection with the infantile that
puts at humor’s disposal the means for this
function. Only in childhood did we experience
intensively painful affects over which to-day as
grown-ups we would laugh; just as a humorist
laughs over his present painful affects. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_381'>381</span>elevation of his ego, of which humoristic displacement
gives evidence,—the translation of
which would read: I am too big to have these
causes affect me painfully—he could find in
the comparison of his present ego with his infantile
ego. This conception is to some extent
confirmed by the rôle which falls to the infantile
in the neurotic processes of repression.</p>

<h4 class='c016'><em>The Relation of Humor to Wit and Comic</em></h4>

<p class='c017'>On the whole humor is closer to the comic
than wit. Like the former its psychic localization
is in the foreconscious, whereas wit,
as we had to assume, is formed as a compromise
between the unconscious and the foreconscious.
On the other hand, humor has no share
in the peculiar nature in which wit and the
comic meet, a peculiarity which perhaps we have
not hitherto emphasized strongly enough. It
is a condition for the origin of the comic that
we be induced to apply—either <em>simultaneously</em>
or in rapid succession—to the same thought
function two different modes of ideas, between
which the “comparison” then takes place and
thus forms the comic difference. Such differences
originate between the expenditure of the
stranger and one’s own, between the usual expenditure
and the emergency expenditure, between
<span class='pageno' id='Page_382'>382</span>an anticipated expenditure and one
which has already occurred.<a id='r84'></a><a href='#f84' class='c007'><sup>[84]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>The difference between two forms of conception
resulting simultaneously, which work with
different expenditures, comes into consideration
in wit, in respect to the hearer. The one
of these two conceptions, by taking the hints
contained in the witticism, follows the train of
thought through the unconscious, while the
other conception remains on the surface and
presents the witticism like any wording from
the foreconscious which has become conscious.
Perhaps it would not be considered an unjustified
statement if we should refer the pleasure
of the witticism heard to the difference between
these two forms of presentation.</p>

<p class='c008'>Concerning wit we here repeat our former
statement concerning its Janus-like double-facedness,
a simile we used when the relation
between wit and the comic still appeared to us
unsettled.<a id='r85'></a><a href='#f85' class='c007'><sup>[85]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_383'>383</span>The character thus put into the foreground
becomes indistinct when we deal with humor.
To be sure, we feel the humoristic pleasure
where an emotional feeling is evaded, which we
might have expected as a pleasure usually belonging
to the situation; and in so far humor
really falls under the broadened conception of
the comic of expectation. But in humor it is
no longer a question of two different kinds of
presentations having the same content; the
fact that the situation comes under the domination
of a painful emotional feeling which
should have been avoided, puts an end to possible
comparison with the nature in the comic
and in wit. The humoristic displacement is
really a case of that different kind of utilization
of a freed expenditure which proved to
be so dangerous for the comic effect.</p>

<h4 class='c016'><em>Formulæ for Wit, Comic, and Humor</em></h4>

<p class='c017'>Now, that we have reduced the mechanism
of humoristic pleasure to a formula analogous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_384'>384</span>to the formula of comic pleasure and of wit,
we are at the end of our task. It has seemed
to us that the pleasure of wit originates from
an <em>economy of expenditure in inhibition</em>, of
the comic from an <em>economy of expenditure in
thought</em>, and of humor from an <em>economy of expenditure
in feeling</em>. All three activities of
our psychic apparatus derive pleasure from
economy. They all strive to bring back from
the psychic activity a pleasure which has really
been lost in the development of this activity.
For the euphoria which we are thus striving
to obtain is nothing but the state of a bygone
time in which we were wont to defray our
psychic work with slight expenditure. It is
the state of our childhood in which we did not
know the comic, were incapable of wit, and did
not need humor to make us happy.</p>

<p class='c008'><a href='#r14'>14</a>. Since this joke will occupy us again and we do not wish to
disturb the discussion following here, we shall find occasion later
to point out a correction in Lipps’s given interpretation which
follows our own.</p>

<p class='c008'><a href='#r17'>17</a>. This same witticism was supposed to have been coined before
by Heine concerning Alfred de Musset.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f18'>
<p class='c008'><a href='#r18'>18</a>. One of the complications involved in the technique of this
example lies in the fact that the modification through which the
omitted abuse is substituted is to be taken as an allusion to the
latter, for it leads to it only through a process of deduction.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f19'>
<p class='c008'><a href='#r19'>19</a>. Another factor which I shall mention later on is also effective
in the technique of this witticism. It has to do with the inner
character of the modification (representation through the opposite—contradiction).
The technique of wit does not hesitate to
make use simultaneously of several means, with which, however,
we can only become acquainted in their sequential order.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f24'>
<p class='c008'><a href='#r24'>24</a>. The excellence of these jokes depends upon the fact that they,
at the same time, present another technical means of a much
higher order.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f25'>

</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f26'>
<p class='c008'><a href='#r26'>26</a>. This resembles an excellent joke of Oliver Wendell Holmes
cited by Brill: “Put not your trust in money, but put your money
in trust.” A contradiction is here announced which does not
appear. At all events it is a good example of the untranslatableness
of the witticisms of such technique.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f27'>
<p class='c008'><a href='#r27'>27</a>. Brill cites a very analogous modification wit: <cite><span lang="la">Amantes—Amentes</span></cite>
(lovers—lunatics).</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f28'>
<p class='c008'><a href='#r28'>28</a>. Compare here K. Fischer (p. 85), who applies the term “double
meaning” to those witticisms in which both meanings are not
equally prominent, but where one overshadows the other. I
have applied this term differently. Such a nomenclature is a matter
of choice. Usage of speech has rendered no definite decision
about them.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f29'>
<p class='c008'><a href='#r29'>29</a>. L. c., page 339.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f30'>
<p class='c008'><a href='#r30'>30</a>. Heine’s answer is a combination of two wit-techniques—a displacement
and an allusion—for he does not say directly: “He
is an ox.”</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f31'>
<p class='c008'><a href='#r31'>31</a>. The word “take,” owing to its meanings, lends itself very
well towards the formation of plays upon words, a pure example
of which I wish to cite as a contrast to the displacement mentioned
above. While walking with his friend, in front of a
café, a well-known stock-plunger and bank director made this
proposal: “Let us go in and take something.” His friend
held him back and said: “My dear sir, remember there are people
in there.”</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f32'>
<p class='c008'><a href='#r32'>32</a>. For the latter see a later chapter. It will perhaps not be
superfluous to add here a few words for better understanding.
The displacement regularly occurs between a statement and an
answer, and turns the stream of thought to a direction different
from the one started in the statement. The justification for
separating the displacement from the double meaning is best
seen in the examples where both are combined, that is, where the
wording of the statement admits of a double meaning which
was not intended by the speaker, but which reveals in the
answer the way to the displacement (see examples).</p>

<p class='c008'><a href='#r45'>45</a>. If I may be permitted to anticipate what later is discussed
in the text I can here throw some light upon the condition which
seems to be authoritative in the usage of language when it is a
question of calling a joke “good” or “poor.” If by means of
a double meaning or slightly modified word I have gotten from
one idea to another by a short route, and if this does not also
simultaneously result in senseful association between the two
ideas, then I have made a “poor” joke. In this poor joke one
word or the “point” forms the only existing association between
the two widely separated ideas. The joke  “Home-Roulard”
used above is such an example. But a “good” joke
results if the infantile expectation is right in the end and if with
the similarity of the word another essential similarity in meaning
is really simultaneously produced—as in the examples Traduttore—Traditore
(translator—traitor), and Amantes—Amentes
(lovers—lunatics). The two disparate ideas which are here
linked by an outer association are held together besides by a
senseful connection which expresses an important relationship
between them. The outer association only replaces the inner connection;
it serves to indicate the latter or to clarify it. Not only
does “translator” sound somewhat similar to “traitor,” but he
is a sort of a traitor whose claims to that name are good. The
same may be said of Amantes—Amentes. Not only do the words
bear a resemblance, but the similarity between “love” and
“lunacy” has been noted from time immemorial.</p>

<p class='c008'>The distinction made here agrees with the differentiation, to be
made later, between a “witticism” and a “jest.” However, it
would not be correct to exclude examples like Home-Roulard
from the discussion of the nature of wit. As soon as we take
into consideration the peculiar pleasure of wit, we discover that
the “poor” witticisms are by no means poor as witticisms, i.e.,
they are by no means unsuited for the production of pleasure.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f51'>
<p class='c008'><a href='#r51'>51</a>. The nonsense-witticisms, which have been somewhat slighted
in this treatise, deserve a short supplementary comment.</p>

<p class='c008'>In view of the significance attributed by our conception to the
factor “sense in nonsense,” one might be tempted to demand
that every witticism should be a nonsense-joke. But this is not
necessary, because only the play with thoughts inevitably leads
to nonsense, whereas the other source of wit-pleasure, the play
with words, makes this impression incidental and does not regularly
invoke the criticism connected with it. The double root of
wit-pleasure—from the play with words and thoughts, which
corresponds to the most important division into word- and thought-witticisms—sets
its face against a short formulation of general
principles about wit as a tangible aggravation of difficulties.
The play with words produces laughter, as is well known, in consequence
of the factor of recognition described above, and therefore
suffers suppression only in a small degree. The play with
thoughts cannot be motivated through such pleasure: it has
suffered a very energetic suppression and the pleasure which it
can give is only the pleasure of released inhibitions. Accordingly
one may say that wit-pleasure shows a kernel of the original
play-pleasure and a shell of removal-pleasure. Naturally we
do not grant that the pleasure in nonsense-wit is due to the
fact that we have succeeded in making nonsense despite the suppression,
while we do notice that the play with words gives us
pleasure. Nonsense, which has remained fixed in thought-wit,
acquires secondarily the function of stimulating our attention
through confusion, it serves as a reinforcement of the effect of
wit, but only when it is insistent, so that the confusion can
anticipate the intellect by a definite fraction of time. That
nonsense in wit may also be employed to represent a judgment
contained within the thought has been demonstrated by the example
on p. <a href='#Page_73'>73</a>. But even this is not the primal signification of
nonsense in wit.</p>

<p class='c008'>A series of wit-like productions for which we have no appropriate
name, but which may lay claim to the designation of
“witty nonsense,” may be added to the nonsense-jokes. They
are very numerous, but I shall cite only two examples: As the
fish was served to a guest at the table he put both hands twice
into the mayonnaise and then ran them through his hair. Being
looked at by his neighbor with astonishment he seemed to have
noticed his mistake and excused himself, saying: “Pardon me,
I thought it was spinach.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Or: “Life is like a suspension bridge,” said the one. “How is
that?” asked the other. “How should I know?” was the answer.</p>

<p class='c008'>These extreme examples produce an effect through the fact that
they give rise to the expectation of wit, so that one makes the
effort to find the hidden sense behind the nonsense. But none
is found, they are really nonsense. Under that deception it was
possible for one moment to liberate the pleasure in nonsense.
These witticisms are not altogether without tendencies, they furnish
the narrator a certain pleasure in that they deceive and
annoy the hearer. The latter then calms his anger by resolving
that he himself should take the place of the narrator.</p>
</div>

</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f53'>
<p class='c008'><a href='#r53'>53</a>. Different points in this declaration would demand an exhaustive
inquiry into an investigation of the pleasure of the
comic, a thing that other authors have already done, and which,
at all events, does not touch our discussion. It seems to me
that Spencer was not happy in his explanation of why the discharge
happens to find just that path, the excitement of which
results in the physical picture of laughter. I should like to add
one single contribution to the subject of the physiological explanation
of laughter, that is, to the derivation or interpretation
of the muscular actions that characterize laughter—a subject
that has been often treated before and since Darwin, but which
has never been conclusively settled. According to the best of
my knowledge the grimaces and contortions of the corners of the
mouth that characterize laughter appear first in the satisfied and
satiated nursling when he drowsily quits the breasts. There it
is a correct motion of expression since it bespeaks the determination
to take no more nourishment, an “enough,” so to speak,
or rather a “more than enough.” This primal sense of pleasurable
satiation may have furnished the smile, which ever remains
the basic phenomenon of laughter, the later connection with the
pleasurable processes of discharge.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f54'>
<p class='c008'><a href='#r54'>54</a>. Cf. <cite>The Interpretation of Dreams</cite>, Chap. VII, also <cite>On the
Psychic Force</cite>, etc., in the above cited book of Lipps (p. 123),
where he says: “This is the general principle: The dominant
factors of the psychic life are not represented by the contents
of consciousness but by those psychic processes which are unconscious.
The task of psychology, provided it does not limit
itself to a mere description of the content of consciousness, must
also consist of revealing the nature of these unconscious processes
from the nature of the contents of consciousness and its temporal
relationship. Psychology must itself be a theory of these
processes. But such a psychology will soon find that there
exist quite a number of characteristics of these processes which
are unrepresented in the corresponding contents of consciousness.”</p>

</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f56'>
<p class='c008'><a href='#r56'>56</a>. Through an example of displacement-wit I desire to discuss
another interesting character of the technique of wit. The
genial actress Gallmeyer when once asked how old she was is
said to have answered this unwelcome question with abashed and
downcast eyes, by saying, “In Brünn.” This is a very good
example of displacement. Having been asked her age, she replied
by naming the place of her birth, thus anticipating the
next query, and in this manner she wishes to imply: “This is a
question which I prefer to pass by.” And still we feel that the
character of the witticism does not here come to expression undimmed.
The deviation from the question is too obvious; the
displacement is much too conspicuous. Our attention understands
immediately that it is a matter of an intentional displacement.
In other displacement-witticisms the displacement
is disguised and our attention is riveted by the effort to discover
it. In one of the displacement-witticisms (p. 69) the reply
to the recommendation of the horse—“What in the world should
I do in Monticello at 6:30 in the morning?”—the displacement is
also an obtrusive one, but as a substitute for it it acts upon
the attention in a senseless and confusing manner, whereas in
the interrogation of the actress we know immediately how to
dispose of her displacement answer.</p>

<p class='c008'>The so-called “facetious questions” which may make use of
the best techniques deviate from wit in other ways. An example
of the facetious question with displacement is the following:
“What is a cannibal who devours his father and mother?—Answer:
An orphan.—And when he has devoured all his other relatives?—Sole-heir.—And
where can such a monster ever find
sympathy?—In the dictionary under S.” The facetious questions
are not full witticisms because the required witty answers
cannot be guessed like the allusions, omissions, etc., of wit.</p>

</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f58'>
<p class='c008'><a href='#r58'>58</a>. Besides the dream-work and the technique of wit I have been
able to demonstrate condensation as a regular and significant
process in another psychic occurrence, in the mechanism of
normal (not purposive) forgetting. Singular impressions put
difficulties in the way of forgetting; impressions in any way
analogous are forgotten by becoming fused at their points of
contact. The confusion of analogous impressions is one of the
first steps in forgetting.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f59'>
<p class='c008'><a href='#r59'>59</a>. Many of my patients while under psychoanalytic treatment
are wont to prove regularly by their laughter that I have succeeded
in demonstrating faithfully to their conscious perception
the veiled unconscious; they laugh also when the content of
what is disclosed does not at all justify this laughter. To be sure,
it is conditional that they have approached this unconscious
closely enough to grasp it when the physician has conjectured it
and presented it to them.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f60'>

<p class='c008'><a href='#r67'>67</a>. I have everywhere identified the naïve with the naïve-comic,
a practice which is certainly not permissible in all cases. But
it is sufficient for our purposes to study the characteristics of the
naïve as exhibited by the “naïve joke” and the “naïve obscenity.”
It is our intention to proceed from here with the investigation of
the nature of the comic.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f68'>
<p class='c008'><a href='#r68'>68</a>. Also Bergson (<cite>Laughter</cite>, An essay on the Meaning of the
Comic, translated by Brereton and Rothwell, The Macmillan Co.,
1914) rejects with sound arguments this sort of explanation of
comic pleasure, which has unmistakably been influenced by the
effort to create an analogy to the laughing of a person tickled.
The explanation of comic pleasure by Lipps which might, in
connection with his conception of the comic, be represented as an
“unexpected trifle,” is of an entirely different nature.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f69'>
<p class='c008'><a href='#r69'>69</a>. The recollection of this innervation expenditure will remain
the essential part of the idea of this motion, and there will
always be methods of thought in my psychic life in which the
idea will be represented by nothing else than this expenditure.
In other connections a substitute for this element may possibly
be put in the form of other ideas, for instance the visual idea
of the object of the motion, or it may be put in the form of the
word-idea; and in certain types of abstract thought a sign instead
of the full content itself may suffice.</p>

in the comparison of big and small, which ultimately also
expresses the essential relation of the child to the grown-up,
would indeed be a peculiar coincidence if the comic had nothing
else to do with the infantile.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f82'>
<p class='c008'><a href='#r82'>82</a>. The excellent humoristic effect of a character like that of
the fat knight, Sir John Falstaff, is based on economised contempt
and indignation. To be sure we recognise in him the
unworthy glutton and fashionably dressed swindler, but our condemnation
is disarmed through a whole series of factors. We
understand that he knows himself to be just as we estimate him;
he impresses us through his wit; and besides that, his physical
deformity produces a contact-effect in favor of a comic conception
of his personality instead of a serious one; as if our demands
for morality and honor must recoil from such a big
stomach. His activities are altogether harmless and are almost
excused by the comic lowness of those he deceives. We admit
that the poor devil has a right to live and enjoy himself like any
one else, and we almost pity him because in the principal situation
we find him a puppet in the hands of one much his superior.
It is for this reason that we cannot bear him any grudge and
turn all we economize in him in indignation into comic pleasure
which he otherwise provides. Sir John’s own humor really
emanates from the superiority of an ego which neither his physical
nor his moral defects can rob of its joviality and security.</p>

<p class='c008'>On the other hand the courageous knight Don Quixote de la
Mancha is a figure who possesses no humor, and in his seriousness
furnishes us a pleasure which can be called humoristic
although its mechanism shows a decided deviation from that of
humor. Originally Don Quixote is a purely comic figure, a big
child whose fancies from his books on knighthood have gone to
his head. It is known that at first the poet wanted to show only
that phase of his character, and that the creation gradually outgrew
the author’s original intentions. But after the poet endowed
this ludicrous person with the profoundest wisdom and
noblest aims and made him the symbolic representation of an
idealism, a man who believed in the realization of his aims, who
took duties seriously and promises literally, he ceased to be a
comic personality. Like humoristic pleasure which results from
a prevention of emotional feelings it originates here through the
disturbance of comic pleasure. However, in these examples we
already depart perceptibly from the simple cases of humor.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f83'>
<p class='c008'><a href='#r83'>83</a>. A term which is used in quite a different sense in the <cite>Aesthetik</cite>

</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f84'>
<p class='c008'><a href='#r84'>84</a>. If one does not hesitate to do some violence to the conception
of expectation, one may ascribe—according to the process
of Lipps—a very large sphere of the comic to the comic of expectation;
but probably the most original cases of the comic which
result through a comparison of a strange expenditure with one’s
own will fit least into this conception.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f85'>
<p class='c008'><a href='#r85'>85</a>. The characteristic of the “double face” naturally did not
escape the authors. Melinaud, from whom I borrowed the above
expression, conceives the condition for laughing in the following
formula: “<span lang="fr">Ce qui fait rire c’est qui est à la fois, d’un coté,
absurde et de l’autre, familier</span>” (“<span lang="fr">Pourquoi rit-on?</span>” <cite><span lang="fr">Revue de
deux mondes</span></cite>, February, 1895). This formula fits in better with
wit than with the comic, but it really does not altogether cover
the former. Bergson (l. c., p. 96) defines the comic situation by
the “reciprocal interference of series,” and states: “A situation
is invariably comic when it belongs simultaneously to two altogether
independent series of events and is capable of being
interpreted in two entirely different meanings at the same time.”
According to Lipps the comic is “the greatness and smallness of
the same.”</p>
